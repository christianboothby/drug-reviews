If you can get past the first few weeks, it really does work.  You can immediately feel the reduction in food cravings and appetite.  I used anti-nausea drugs to help me the first week and then I had no issues.  You do have to follow a healthy diet, but for people who eat compulsively it makes a big difference in being able to resist junk food and reduce your food intake.  This ultimately allows your body to adjust to healthier food and shrink your stomach.”",Contrave,Obesity,214,412,5,oral

However, after awhile these went away. For the last 6 months I have been able to loose 33 pounds by only taking 1 pill at night. My physician is moving my dose up to 2 pills now, one the AM and one in the PM. I started that regimen this week and I am back to experiencing a little dizziness and dry mouth, odd dreams (not as much as the beginning). But, I am sure this will disappear as well soon.

It has improved my mood and made me able to walk past food without stopping. I take snacks to eat during the day but usually don’t even touch them. I have been able to drop my cals to 1600-1800/ day. It’s also had an incredible effect on my libido and performance. My wife is loving it. It is not a miracle drug.

And I am someone who relies on Wellbutrin for mental health but, I was 15lbs overweight. I knocked of the 1st 20lbs with diet and exercise but menopause or age (53) just wouldn’t let me shed the last 15. So, spoke to my GP and we decided to try this. This medicine worked for me! I now think of food as nutrition not entertainment or a crutch when I am bored. Anyway I have 6 more lbs to go and then will tapper off and go back to Wellbutrin straight.

Also if you read this and think that well if you reduce your calories 1800 or less of course you will loose weight and that's true however before taking this drug I would have never been able to be limiting my food to this amount and feel fine . So I'm hoping by shrinking my stomach  using this when I am eventually  weaned off this drug my natural appetite  will be at a more reasonable  level so I can maintain.

The brain fog many speak of turned into severe headaches and nausea turned into violent bouts of vomiting. To a point that I thought I would have to be admitted to the hospital. Also, unaware this contains  an opiate  blocker naltrexone and the ingredient bupropion used to treat depression, the neurological effects were also quite concerning. I had spasms in my muscles and joints, like small surges of electric shock.

On this I have a bit of nausea and light headedness at first but it was very minor. Right away I felt my appetite decreasing. I did watch what I ate but didn’t restrict any specific foods just a whole lot less of it.

I still have very strong cravings for sweets and carbs and since I am not able to walk, I have been giving into those cravings.  I need diet and exercise to go hand in hand for a successful weight loss program.  The drug did not alter my taste for the foods I love or help control portions.

Usually after large meals and usually if they included fats or dairy. I stopped pills and pain went away. Fast forward to a couple months ago when I decided to try again. THIS time I am VERY MOTIVATED. I'm using watching my food and strictly 1200 calories a day. I'm working out at the gym and I've lost 21 pounds in about 6 weeks. I believe 100% that the Contrave is helping me stick to the diet by taking away cravings and helping me feel more content eating good food. 
I've not had any of those bouts of stomach pain this time around. I don't know if they were related or not but I'm never eating more than 400-500 calories at a time. Bottom line: this is a good tool if you are ready to get serious about your weight.”",Contrave,Obesity,214,412,5,oral

It does not take away my cravings as well as that first time but it does decrease the edge.  I agree with lots of others...it is NOT a miracle pill.  It is designed to curb your CRAVINGS, like binging.  I do see a little bit of help but it is expensive.  It has never worked as well as the initial time I started it though.

I cannot drink more than one glass of wine, and it doesn't even taste good.  I have no cravings for sweets, and when I taste them, I think meh, not worth the calories.  Obviously, it has rewired my reward system and satiety signals.  As far as side effects, yes, at first I was jittery with a strange lightheaded headache but it was pretty mild.  I often have a dry mouth so I'm drinking more water.  I think it does cause constipation but I've always been on the loose side, so my bowel movements have normalized.

Yes, at first I had nighttime headaches, some nausea in the morning after I took my pills and dizziness.  One weird effect is that I no longer am a coffee addict. Strange. Another effect  is the following:  I had cataract surgery last week and was told I could continue my Contrave.  I was told my IV sedation would be Versed and Fentanyl and would be given in a small amount.  After the IV sedation was started, I felt absolutely no effect. I was given lots of local anesthetic in my eye so my surgery was bearable but, frankly, it DID HURT!  Then it dawned on me, the naltrexone in Contrave decreased significantly the effects of the opioid analgesic Fentanyl.  I'd forgotten that Fentanyl is an opioid.

I feel great, no side effects and am losing about 2lbs per week so I want to keep where I’m at. If I plateau I’ll probably go up to 4 pills.

It seems like this medication takes a while to build. In the beginning I had a very slight change in appetite but now it’s far more significant. I try to follow a 1500 calorie diet and often come in a few hundred calories below and just feel too full. Never thought that’d be something I’d say.

The next March I met with my endocrinologist again, who put me on the drug.  I told him what happened, and he said it wasn't the Contrave and encouraged me to start again.  So in March 2017 I started.  I weighed 258 lbs   I won't lie, the first week was rough.  Nausea, feeling out of sorts, but after reading reviews on this sight I took others advice.  I started taking Dramamine with the pills.  Also took my time with the pill increase.  I took 1 pill for a month, than added on 2 pills for a month, than 3.  I weened off the Dramamine and am feeling fine.  I met with my Endocrinologist in June, down 31 lbs.  He was ecstatic!  It was the best Dr. visit of my life.  He said to keep doing what I have been. As of today - Sept 11, 2017, I have been on the drug 6 months, I am down 40 lbs.  I still only take 3 pills a day as that seems to be working.  If I hit a plateau I will add the 4th.

I was very nervous about starting Contrave given what I had read about the side effects. I don%u2019t take meds very often, and I didn't like the idea of going on a recurring and long term pill. That being said, the first week on Contrave has been incredible. I will say I was food obsessed before. Thoughts of food ran through my head throughout the day, and the idea of eating was always there.

I had no idea how much mental energy I had been spending pushing those thoughts aside. Now, with Contrave, my head is clear. I no longer sit at my desk and watch the clock, waiting until it%u2019s a reasonable time to eat, or force myself to push on another hour before ultimately giving in and getting a snack.

Drinking lots of water should help with a lot of the side effects. Lost 8lbs in 2 1/2 weeks. This medicine works by turning off the ""pleasure"" of eating so you can eat for nourishment only.

I find that once you are able to tolerate a dose, weight loss stabilises. That’s when a dose increase is due. My concern is that once I hit the maximum dose of 3mg and am able to tolerate it,  it will no longer be effective for weight loss. I feel that it requires another drug, such as Contrave, to reinforce its strength. That becomes an extremely expensive combination in Australia.

I feel so much better and I also stopped drinking alcohol entirely and I don’t have any desire too. Saxenda is only a tools though, if you keep your habits nothing will change.

I have been on for 6 weeks now and I have gone from 236lb to 222lb, 16 pounds down. I am simply never hungry. A few things from my experience:
- If your current dose is working, wait to increase until you feel it less effective. When I tried going up faster, the side effects were worse. I am actually still at 2.4 and it is working great. Since I am paying for this out of pocket, I am thankful I can extend the use.
- I would say my side effects have been manageable. However, they are disruptive to my life. I always feel like I have a lump in the back of my throat, like I might get sick, and my stomach always has a mild icky feeling...its ALL the time. 
- Anything with onion or garlic gives me heartburn.... and they never use to

I've noted that I 'pay' for eating too much at a meal with a stomach ache, since stomach emptying is slowed. I've also noticed a slight increase in systolic BP (still ok). The last issue is that I actually lost interest in food completely a couple of weeks ago. I had to purposefully go shopping to find 'yummy foods', and managed to re-kindle my interest. 

Net is that this is a good med, but you need to listen to your body while you're taking it, and write everything down that you're putting in your mouth while you're on it.

Yesterday I was three months on Saxenda.
Starting weight 194 lbs ( I am 5’2”).
Today I’m 160 pounds.
Very mild side effects on my first week, until I switched the administration time from morning to bed time.
No more nausea. Constipation is still a problem for me, still working hard to manage this.
Injection site also has become a little challenging, but because it’s summer I don’t want to use my arms or legs, so I stick with my tummy area which has become very itchy and lumpy.
My fitness pal app also helps with watching my cals, I am not exceeding 1000/ day.
It works for me and my life is getting better every day.”",Saxenda,Obesity,2,217,26,injection

To counteract side effects of nausea & gastrointestinal adverse reactions, I plan out 6 small meals/day.  Fortunately, this has eliminated all negative side effects. However, at Christmas, I ate a large Christmas dinner and became violently ill.

I am hoping when I increase to 1.2mg on Sunday that I will start to feel my appetite decrease. 
I haven't lost weight yet either, but I acknowledge it is only 4 days, plus I haven't exercised this week. So I take responsibility for that.

My side effects thus far have been TERRIBLE. Extreme nausea, acid reflux, severe fatigue - even some moderate to severe dizziness. I'm not enjoying it much HOWEVER - it seems to improve 10 - 12 days after each dose increase.

Dosing: because of my side effects I've needed to slow my dose progression. Every 2 weeks I increase by 0.6 mg.

My portion control was out of whack before. The med made it easy for me to do this. I lost another 10lbs the second month (on 30mg) and was officially not obese BMI anymore!

How I feel: This morning after taking pill, I could barely eat! I feel weak, but also energized (weird). I am having dry mouth, but not severe, and blurred vision. Im extremely excited to see how this works for me. Hopefully the diet treats me well.

1) Before you even take it, make sure you discuss with your gp to monitor your progress and health.
2) Have a low fat & calorie diet at least a week prior to taking it. You can then iron out any clinks e.g. I am prone to late night binges so I made sure I put some extra emotional support in place and stocked the cupboard with healthy low fat snacks.
3) Make sure you have got some low fat ingredients and recipes to hand. The following I have found super useful:
Low calorie cooking spray
Reduced fat hummus and cheese
Pitta bread
Crumpets with a tsp of peanut butter
Fruit and veg
Beans, pulses and legumes: make these your best friend.

To understand how this product works you have to know what it does. It blocks a certain amount of the fat you eat from being aborbed into your body and thus reduces your calorie/fat intake. It's not a miracle drug, if you eat a very high fat diet yes it may help a bit but it won't do ALL the work.

Also, if you eat little/no fat anyway it can't help as it won't do anything for you. It can't block fat that isn't there. 

If like me you're on a long term diet it can really boost your success. I have gone from a bmi of 47 to 39 in 6 months. Still some way to go but Alli is helping a great deal and keeps me motivated with consistent weekly weight losses.”",Orlistat,Obesity,7,107,16,oral

This isn't a magic pill that will make you lose weight overnight without any effort, you have to make the effort to exercise a little, moderate your food proportion and set a calorie limit every day.

I have been on Adipex for 8 weeks, and I have lost 17 lbs. I lost and gained, and then lost again during this time, lol. I have not taken it everyday; I probably have missed about 15 doses in the 8 weeks. I realize this kind of throws off my results.

I have had no major side effects that link to the Adipex. It still gives me dry mouth. It continues to help curb my appetite, and even on the days that I forget to take it, my appetite is smaller than it was before I started the medication. I will update again in 8 weeks.

When I'm hungry at lunch I occasionally had a egg and bacon sandwich but cooked in no fat and using fry lite spray, cut the fat off the meat. I have a sensible normal dinner and breakfast sometimes toast with no butter with a banana inside or a couple slices ham. I have cut out all the junk. Side effects for the first few days slight tummy cramp and very occasionally a looser stool when going to the toilet, but no other side effects at all.”",Xenical,Obesity,7,107,16,oral

I also go for 1/2 hour walks each day. With most meals I've cut back the portions that I was eating and have done substitutions of meals such as Grilled cheese sandwiches instead of having 2 Burgers, also 1% milk instead of 2%. I bake potatoes in the microwave than cut them up and fry them instead of eating heavily fat laden hashbrowns and I'm also eating lots of Fibre foods, and eating fat free egg whites(flavored) instead of regular eggs.”",Xenical,Obesity,7,107,16,oral

Had two accidents already in 3 days. Oily discharge leaking and making my underwear smell bad as well, which must be noticeable. Haven't taken my second dose today. Want to give this a fair trial but unable to leave the house for fear of accidents. Will see if half the 120mg dosage works better on me. ”",Xenical,Obesity,7,107,16,oral

4062,10,"September 26, 2008",, 190,"“I found Xenical to work very well. True it did have side effects, but that was a good motivator to make healthier food choices. When I was food wise, I didn't have any problems. I lost 10 pounds in 1.5 months walking 10,000 steps per day and eating healthy.

I did get the headaches associated with the side effects, but they weren't as bad as my normal sinusitis headaches, so it was do-able.
I would recommend this to anyone in conjunction with a healthy diet and exercise. Exercise is a must, because this does not speed your metabolism up.

Have faith, stay strong and you can do ANYTHING you put your mind to.”",Xenical,Obesity,7,107,16,oral
