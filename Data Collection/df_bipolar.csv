0,9,"October 27, 2020",Taken for less than 1 month, 0,Lamictal (lamotrigine):			“I just started taking Lamictal last night.  I wear a fitbit so I have data to show that my sleep has improved immediately.  I usually only hit REM once per night with 1mg of Klonopin and 10 mg of Propranolol but I went into REM 4 times last night and I woke up at 4am and worked out. I do notice dry eyes and mouth but I'm not sure if it's the extra deep sleep or the medication but I feel stable today for once in a very long time.  I'm not fixated on racing ridiculous angry thoughts. I'm genuinely content and not overly talkative like usual. I've slowed down enough to enjoy moments. I'm only taking 25 mg per day right now. Going to take a folic acid supplement since the warning label said it could reduce this vitamin. Also concerned about it interfering with birth control.”,Lamotrigine,BiPolar Disorder,6,231,14,oral

I miss the manic episodes but I don’t miss quitting my dream job for no apparent reason, other than something trivial setting me off. That went on for years. Bad impulsive decisions, regretting once my mood swung back the other way, repeat. No side effects for me. I take 300mg a night. I wish I would have known about this medication 30 years ago. I can only imagine where I’d be today. I think it took a few weeks to start to notice the change. I will never stop taking it. I’m very happy to see that it has helped others. I’m pretty much normal now. Even keel. I still struggle with intrusive thoughts, but it’s minimal.”",Lamotrigine,BiPolar Disorder,6,231,14,oral

I have been treated for mood disorders since I was 12, and I was officially diagnosed with Bipolar type 2 earlier this year. The only other mood stabilizer that I took with lithium which did not help at all. I was really scared starting this med because of the Stevens-Johnson syndrome risk, but it has just forced me to make sure I never miss a dose. My PA titrated me up very slowly, and I’m on 250 mg/ day. I’ve been on this dosage for almost a month and I recently started getting acne from the med, which is really rare I guess but it freaked me out a lot. I just adjusted my routine and I spot treat pimples. Overall, this med really helps contain my hypomanic episodes but it doesn’t really help me with the major depression slumps, which my PA warned me about. I want to increase my dosage, but I am scared that this acne will enhance immensely.”",Lamotrigine,BiPolar Disorder,6,231,14,oral
3,9,"October 3, 2020",Taken for 10 years or more, 15,"Lamictal (lamotrigine):			“Lamictal is life changer for bipolar 2, stopped throwing myself at alcohol to control tensions and hyper-reactivity, am less hyper sensitive and self-protectively aloof. Lost 20 lbs gained on Depakote. Cons: losing some mental sharpness. A little less smart, not inadequately but less quick and on-target. But easier to live with and happier. Well worth it! Sometimes need adjunct treatment for depression. (I recommend light therapy.) Doesn’t help intrusive thoughts, rehashing invasive memories; now trying clomipramine alongside. HAS been good for depression and especially hypomania, allows for ups, but curbs impulsive out-there behavior and hyper sensitivity. 
For me, the generic does NOT work as well. 
On 200 mg; tried 300mg and 400mg without added benefit and with disadvantages: you can feel missing a dose badly; after 6 hours of missing dose on 300mg I got lightheaded and found it difficult to drive. Some twitching and clumsiness on higher dose, but manageable. Go with the lowest dose that works.”",Lamotrigine,BiPolar Disorder,6,231,14,oral
4,10,"September 25, 2020",, 28,"Lamictal (lamotrigine):			“I was put on lamictal for Borderline Personality Disorder/PTSD/Anxiety/Major Depressive.  The only noticeable side effects for me were slight irritability and becoming more easily frustrated than usual in the beginning, along with drowsiness after taking the nightly dose. I can honestly say that after working out the kinks, this medication has changed my life. I have more energy, I sleep better, and I am able to let go of less than ideal situations instead of being consumed by them. I no longer default to self harm and suicidal ideation, and my thoughts are much less hyperbolic and more aware/rooted in reality. I cannot remember the last time I was this stable and happy. I have not experienced any rashes or physical changes other than my appetite slightly decreasing and losing a bit of weight. 150mg is definitely the sweet spot for me and I do not intend to increase my dose at this time. I would highly recommend this medication, especially if you are like me and have exhausted every other option.”",Lamotrigine,BiPolar Disorder,6,231,14,oral

I’m now on Lamotrigine 200mg x 2 per day and have very few truly low days. I’m much more engaged with my life, kids, friends; when asked how I am I can genuinely say I feel good or even great.

Side effects initially just nausea & nystagmus when I increased the dose.  The nausea has now come back & I’m struggling to eat enough. I eat regularly until I feel sick but am loosing 2-3lb per month & I wasn’t big to begin with.

I’ve also been more distracted & it’s harder to remember things. I even get distracted when driving & have more extreme hyper days. But I’m also getting much more done so at the moment that feels great.  

My Dr says Lamotrigine is great for depression but not so good for the hyper end so suggests I either add in Ampriprazole or lower my dose, which I’m trying first.

For me the life changing benefits by far outweigh the side effects.  I just need to sort out the weight loss.”",Lamotrigine,BiPolar Disorder,6,231,14,oral

Diagnosed with bipolar I had tried so many different kinds of medications. My medicine cabinet looked like a freaking pharmacy. Now I am down to one drug a day! That drug is lamictal!!!! Literally my saving grace. All the psychiatrist I saw. All the different medication combinations I had tried only scratched the surface. My newest psychiatrist suggested this drug. I was skeptical because none of the other Drs I saw suggested it and I didn't know it existed. This drug is a miracle.... It has changed how I live. How I care for my kids. How I see the world.

I had to do a quick detox off of the lithium because of the birth defects associated with lithium and pregnancy. It was a horrible few weeks coming off of it (I did a quick 2 weeks taper) and the few weeks after that were bad. My new dr put me on a low dose of lamictal in combination with buspar for my anxiety.

It turned out the lamictal was causing problems with my biotin/vitamin b intake. After talking to my psych and stopping lamictal and taking biotin supplements, I could finally pass stool easily and slowly my hair grew back... though I sort of missed my leg and underarm hair not growing.

I take it in conjunction with a low dose of abilify, and the combination has kept me from having manic/depressive for about a year straight now, something I never thought possible. At first I was just on abilify— a pretty high dose— and while it kept me free from hypomania, it didn’t really do much for the depression. Lamictal, on the other hand, has worked wonders in that respect. Very little side effects— I wake up nauseous but it fades after about an hour, and it’s definitely worth it. Other than that, no weight gain, and I believe it may have actually increased my previously nonexistent sex drive. The best part of lamictal is that I don’t feel flat or subdued. I’m still having the normal ups and downs of life, but for the first time, I feel pretty confident that they’re not bipolar related.

Over time, I developed mixed and irritable hypomanic states to which Lamotrigine had little to no effect.

In treatment three days later (a group program), a group leader commented that she had never seen me so calm before. I thought it might even just be a placebo effect that would wear off, but for the past month and a half things have stayed good.

I've always had trouble sleeping so the combo of Latuda and Xanax takes care of that.

So my employer is aware of my condition and we structure my workload, such that I do serious creative computer programming in the afternoon after the ""dulling"" wears off.  My advice is to take it all at 8pm and get in bed at 8:30 - 9:00.  Then you will be able to do normal work at 9am and complex work after noon.  Diet and exercise are key, because you have to manage the diabetes that comes with it.  If I feel depressed or manic, I might add 400mg and that usually fixes it, but that is probably risky.

I work as a hostess at a restaurant and customers will make comments such as “Are you tired? You are yawning!” Or “Are you chewing gum?” and it significantly affected my self-esteem. My doctor recommended Lamictal after telling him my concern with the Tardive Dyskinesia. He first kept me on the Abilify and started on low dosages of Lamictal so that I can slowly ease into the new drug. If I remember correctly, he started me on 10mg, 25mg, 50mg, 100mg then finally 200mg which is what I am on now. I believe I have been on 200mg since about February of 2019.

After just a month (I titrated up quickly, so I've been on 100 for 2 weeks. probably best not do that there's a fatal skin disease you can get) my low level depression feels better. 

I'd say it's genuinely beneficial for bipolar depression. A little dizziness but not so bad, and it fades. My friends say there's no evidence that more than 100mg or 150 helps, but it could increase side effects. 100 is good”",Lamictal,BiPolar Disorder,6,231,14,oral

Find your correct dose that works well , and remember good sleep equals good mood. If you feel sleepy the next day , thats if ' drink some coffee + 1 cup of water.

I sobbed reading every comment, because I can relate.  My 18 year old son has psychosis and mania.
Meds just changed.
Lithium dropped due to “out of range” high toxicity. 
Antipsychotic med. Risperidone, no longer affective after a year.
He has been on Abilify for 1 week.
After 1 day, I could tell his psychosis was disappearing. 
He realized date on the calendar, acted as if he had missed a month of his life. Then immediately jumped back in the game!
He showered with soap!
His obsessive, fixated thoughts and actions stopped, and he quickly 
reprioritized his responsibilities. 
Side affects- nausea, sick, no appetite for days.  (Zofran) is helping. 
Slightly more aggravated at times, pesters family, a little removed, impulsive and quick to snap.
It’s only been a week, so hoping these symptoms stop, and mood levels out.

Compulsive gambling addiction is a mental health disorder itself.  Who'd have thought that the NHS would prescribe this dangerous drug that can cause it?

Sounds ridiculous but true.  There was a guy with Parkinsons prescribed it in England, went full on the National Lottery online games and scratch cards etc ... but won his case for not being advised properly of the potential side effects and got most of the losses back.

reprioritized his responsibilities.

I was taking 1200 mg of Lithium daily which was causing the worst stomach pains and I was constantly running to the bathroom.  I started Vraylar and almost immediately saw a positive effect.  My stomach pains went away, my mood became more balanced, and it even helped with my cognitive abilities as well.  

Short term side effects were stomach ache, shaky hands, and uneasiness, but they went away after 2-3 days of taking the medication.  

I've noticed such an improvement (and so has my wife), that we only wish this drug was on the market years ago.  I would highly recommend this as an option for BP 1 if you have tried all of the other medications.

And I can't take it in the morning because it makes me feel drunk-tired and for lack of a better word, completely high.  As exhausted as I am, I still feel like I could take on the day without sleep.  

Other side effects are dizziness, restlessness, shakiness, headache, upset stomach, intense hunger, feeling like I'm catching a cold, can't stay asleep, blurred vision (I'm typing with one eye closed), irritability, difficulty concentrating, and an intense manic episode starting about an hour after taking the pill, lasting all day.

The only side effects I have experienced are significant sleepiness in the morning and muscle twitches and stiffness.

I felt like a new (or like my old) self within a couple days, on this miracle drug. My dosages have varied depending on the other medicines (antidepressants and ADD medicines) I'm on. The only major side effect I've had that never went away (been on it for 7 years) was the sedation in the morn ing (I took my whole dose in evening). Now I take 20mgs 3x/day and 40mgs at bedtime, then 20mgs when required for anxiety. Right now I also take Wellbutrin XL and I'm titrating up on Abilify due to breakthrough depression. Geodon helps both mania and depression and I found it to be very weight neutral.”",Ziprasidone,BiPolar Disorder,244,347,69,oral

I have struggled with my life, sense of who I am, losing great jobs, ruining relationships and never knowing when I would lose control was the worst part. I'm now on 80 mg of Geodon for 6 months. For the first two weeks waking up was hard and I felt groggy but you can get through it if you give it a chance. This medication has changed my entire life. I've even lost weight. I'm living now. I just hope this can help someone because I never believed any medicine would work. I have been on all A-Z. I only wish I had found Geodon sooner. ”",Ziprasidone,BiPolar Disorder,244,347,69,oral
