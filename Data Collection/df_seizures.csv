The remaining tumor is slow growing and is benign. I'm prescribed 500mg of levetiracetam twice a day to stop the seizures.  Until today, I didn't realize that drinking alcohol can induce seizures.  I am a daily drinker. I have had about 6 clonic seizures. Had one April/2020 and they upped me up to 750mg twice a day. Yesterday I had one beer, felt like a seizure was coming on. Have had weird feelings about being outside, a sense of panic, and almost like I'm trying to talk myself into having a seizure. Like I'm barely in control. I would not drink alcohol, or not very much. I believe my was body craving alcohol while sleeping. I never had the anger issues, but recently it feels more like anxiety. Be very careful with the amount of this drug that is prescribed. I can definitely feel the difference since this ""slight"" increase. My son (at age 12) had to be taken off it. His behavior really changed.”",Levetiracetam,Seizures,3,204,3,oral

The first four weeks were awful, she was aggressive and scary. I needed extra help to stop her attacking her siblings. HOWEVER this calmed down after 4-6 weeks and she I now back to normal.

After multiple seizures back to back like 20+ the only thing that would even help control them was name brand medication (Keppra)they started him out at six 500 mg daily. Many different symptoms with this I've noticed over the years so I will list a few: mood swings, anxiety, depression, memory loss of dates & time, agitated, lies.

 Talk to the  doctor about the amount of seizures he experienced since last visit and at times gets violent.

For the first month or so I was absolutely fine, with the only noticeable side effects being the occasional bout of nausea before breakfast. However, at the 2-3 month mark my moods started to worsen, I became withdrawn, lost interest in a lot of my previous hobbies, and just felt pretty rubbishy in general. At the 5 month mark, I had a nervous breakdown and spent a whole night throwing hurting myself. After this, I tapered myself off the medication, and my life improved significantly.

Levetericatam is horrible. Wouldn't recommend this drug to anyone, though I'll give it a rating of 2, since it technically got rid of my seizures.”",Levetiracetam,Seizures,3,204,3,oral

I was despondent, hated life, had no motivation and cried at the drop of a hat. Finally, I knew it was time to go to the doctor to transition off when I hit such a low low.

Whenever they raise the dosage on me I have to go to the dentist once a month with issues with my gums bleeding or a tooth being on the verge of being a cavity, and I brush twice a day and floss every night before bed.

Neurologist suggested I move to a 1000mg dose once a day of extended release pills. On their recommendation, I took my typical 500mg standard release in the morning, and then 1000mg (2 500mg pills) extended release dose tonight. Dear god the side effects. My whole body became jittery, I was having panic attacks, and my eyes were fluttering so much I thought I’d have another seizure at any moment. I didn’t, and after 6 terrifying hours I’m mostly back to normal. I will no longer take both pills at once as directed, and will instead spread the doses as I had been with the standard release.

Occasionally I feel the emotional effects of depression, and mood swings but am able to mentally talk myself out of the negative mental state, change the emphasis of what is causing the irritability, and changing my environment ( getting out and socializing, viewing nature, what ever it takes).

It really controls the jerks with little or no side effects. I never feel anxious or moody or any of the things that some of the other people are talking about. I only take 250 mg in the morning and at night I have complete control.

I got my license back 3 years ago as I had my second seizure at age 19 and had my license taken away so now at the age of 25 I couldn't be happier. I never look back and think I will have another but I will probably take keppra the rest of my life if it is what is helping me and my epilepsy.
