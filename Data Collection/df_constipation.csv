0,1,"October 22, 2020",, 1,“My doctor recommended me to take 2 of these everyday due to constipation I was having. I took 2 on October 20th and felt fine all day. I even pooped a little bit and I thought I got all my poop out. Until the night time I got really bad stomach cramps and started to feel sick. I woke up the next morning and had to run to the bathroom I was pooping straight liquid 3 times an hour. But as my doctor recommended I took 2 more at 1pm October 21st that was the biggest mistake. I started feeling incredibly nauseous so I took a nap hoping to sleep through the night because I have an extreme fear of throwing up.  I ended up waking up at 7pm and thought I was going to throw up I never did but I felt like it all night. I was continuously pooping it eventually turned clear! In conclusion NEVER take this medicine. it was the WORST decision of my whole entire life. I was crying all day. DO NOT TAKE THIS!”,Bisacodyl,Constipation,0,205,1,oral

I am assured by my medical professional that it is just the sudden change and that my body hasn't adapted yet, despite me staying hydrated and eating plenty of fibre. 
So I went to ""Wilko"" and picked up a pack of their own brand Bisocodyl and took in the MORNING of a day off. I didn't fancy being woken up in the middle of the night and had no plans...so 8 am I took one of these with a pint of water. Within 30 minutes I had the urge ""to go"" and it was a proper experience. A solid movement where I instantly felt relieved, although not 100%. Fast-forward about 7 hours and I got slight cramping before another movement which started solid and then turned to diarrhoea. Luckily I wasn't on the toilet for ages.

Immediately I drank over a Litre of water and sparkling water and a 1/4 cup of juice with some fiber mixed in, hoping that this would give me an easier time with everything.
I woke up at 12:00am with my stomach all tight and feeling like it was in knots. I went to the bathroom to do a wee. No movement but lots of cramping in stomach. I drank another 1/2L of water. It’s now 12:41am and I have had a liquid movement, it just came pouring out of me like crazy but now my stomach feels a bit better and it wasn’t as bad as I expected.

On the Bristol Stool chart (that is a chart the doctors use to classify your poo), I’ll often have type 1 stools which are like passing rocks out of your butt and take an eternity while tearing your rectum apart. So I took 4 duclolax pills and over the course of the day, things improved, but I did feel some nausea and I had 4 BMs. So it will definitely make you poop. I normally drink coffee in the morning and then just go every morning once. On Dulcolax, as I wrote, I went 4 times  in 1 day, but it did change the stool shape positively. On the Bristol chart I probably ended up at type 3 (normal) by the evening so I generally think it’s a good product if you suffer from pooping rocks like I do. That is the worse feeling in the world and this will fix it, but you will go multiple times in the day.

It's a STIMULANT LAXATIVE. 

That means your gastro intestinal muscles squeeze really hard to get rid of anything inside

Please understand, this is not for tum-tum discomfort, it's for clearing a blockage, and it will ABSOLUTELY clear your constipation. 

As with any type of medication, one should assess one's tolerance the first time taking this. 

The directions say 1-3 tablets, so start with ONE. Don't START with 2 or 3!! Also, expect some cramping and other side effects. If you take the right dosage, it will likely be unpleasant, but, tolerable. Don't be surprised if you find yourself running to the bathroom a few times, because this is going to CLEAR YOU OUT.

To everyone who are complaining this tablet doesn't work you should know that the tablet should be consumed if you are suffering from constipation for more than 2 days. Try natural methods such as eating more fibre and drinking more water first or have psyllium husk. If all fails then take the tablet. It will surely work with sufficient water.

Also take only one at a time don't go about taking 2 or 3 tablets at once, even if the package says it. Always try one first.

Drink at least 500mls of an electrolyte drink such as gatorade etc and a piece of toast or something with some Fibre....

If you have never taken before take ONE TABLET ONLY ONE!!!!

Take literally right before you go to sleep As you will have a bowel motion the next day

This week I tried dulcolax.  I bought it from asda and in the first night I took 1. Nothing all night but during the day I had stomach cramps (mild). Finally I had a small stool. It Was painful like usual but not as much. Last nigh I took another. And I passed a larger stool. I'm a bit worried from reading bad reviews so I don't want to push to two pills so I'm going to stick to one tonight and hopefully I get back to a good rhythm.

Start with 1 the first time, and never take more than 2.

Drink lots of water - if you are not hydrated they will make you feel nauseas.

Only take for moderate to severe constipation, if it’s mild you will experience severe cramps.

On the Bristol Stool chart (that is a chart the doctors use to classify your poo), I’ll often have type 1 stools which are like passing rocks out of your butt and take an eternity while tearing your rectum apart. So I took 4 duclolax pills and over the course of the day, things improved, but I did feel some nausea and I had 4 BMs. So it will definitely make you poop. I normally drink coffee in the morning and then just go every morning once. On Dulcolax, as I wrote, I went 4 times  in 1 day, but it did change the stool shape positively. On the Bristol chart I probably ended up at type 3 (normal) by the evening so I generally think it’s a good product if you suffer from pooping rocks like I do.

It's a STIMULANT LAXATIVE. 

That means your gastro intestinal muscles squeeze really hard to get rid of anything inside

Please understand, this is not for tum-tum discomfort, it's for clearing a blockage, and it will ABSOLUTELY clear your constipation. 

As with any type of medication, one should assess one's tolerance the first time taking this. 

The directions say 1-3 tablets, so start with ONE. Don't START with 2 or 3!! Also, expect some cramping and other side effects.

I was pretty skeptical about this working given the amount of pain I’d previously gone through, but the relief this has brought me is immense. I had just a little more than half the bottle (about 6 oz) and on a slightly empty stomach it seemed to do the trick.

No just No. That can be dangerous and the bottle specifically says do not drink more than one bottle in a 24 hour period. Believe it or not magnesium toxicity can hurt or even kill people. Other than that - this stuff works! If you aren't going to the bathroom after drinking a bottle of this, then you should head straight to your doctors office as something is amiss. One bottle of this and expect to be incapacitated for quite a few hours. Do not make plans outside of sitting on your toilet after drinking this. It takes longer to hit some people but once it does watch out!

Drink tons of glasses of water throughout the 16 hours after taking this. Don't drink this and ONE glass of water and think you're done. I literally get another round every time I drink another glass.

It's a fun combination, said no one ever. 
In the last 5yrs, IBS-c symptoms are the most prevalent. Recently, I experienced SEVERE constipation (nearly 8+ days). I was terribly bloated, my abdomin was distended, had gas pains (under each side of my rib cage), and even chest pains. 

I took dulcolax for women at the onset of this situation. It barely worked. It did however cause me to curl up in the fetal position on a hotel floor room (I was traveling for business) for over 2.5hrs while grabbing my stomach in agony due to the severe cramping it caused. Cold sweats and crying out for my mom (at 33yrs old) accompanied the pain. 

So imagine my hesitation when my parents urged me to take M.O.M. while visiting for the holiday. 
Even with the fear of being curled up on the bathroom floor in my childhood home- I gave into my concerned parents recommendation of taking M.O.M. 
Night 1 - I was scared of cramping (even though the label clearly states - stimulant & cramp free) so I only took 45ml vs. 60ml prior to bed. 
I woke up and had success! Multiple BM's but still felt (knew) I was constipated. 
Night 2 - knowing I had not successfully passed everything- I took 60ml prior to bed. 
Within 2 hrs I had multiple (I mean multiple) BM's and still am today - over 36hrs later. 

I cannot say enough about M.O.M. it will most certainly become my go to - if this should happen again (which I know it will). It's effective and I did not experience any negative side effects! No cramping!”",Phillips' Milk of Magnesia,Constipation,6,292,74,oral

I am a regular guy, regular build, height, size. Aged 61 and a Leo (not that this makes a difference). 
When I say I'm a regular guy I mean that in the last 60 odd years I have been as regular as clockwork in the BM (Bowel Movement) department That was until last Saturday morning.
WARNING GRAPHIC DETAILS FOLLOW: (Written in laymen's terms)
Day 1:  Saturday
I awoke went to the loo, nothing happened!   I sat there needing a wee and if you are like me during or shortly after I wee I poo.  Not today!
Got up off the loo and went about my day. Several times though the day I went and sat on the loo and tried to pee, with just a trickle for my efforts. I felt that I really needed a poo. 
As the day went on I felt almost as if each bum cheek was solid, I mean rock hard. (That's not good)I was thinking to myself. Still unable to poo and pushing on each bum cheek to try and move stuff about a bit in the hope that I might be able to squeeze a bit out. NOPE! Went to bed.
Day 2: Sunday
I awoke in the morning really really needing a wee and a poo.  Still rock hard bum cheeks but now liquid poo was dripping/running out of my bum.  This persisted throughout the day every time I sat on the loo.  I spent four hours sitting there trying desperately to go the pain was so bad I was literally screaming in pain. The pain was situated mostly around my perineum.  
I would describe pain as having an elephant standing with its back legs on your dick and its front legs bouncing on your bladder OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOuch! This continued all day.
I tried two table spoons of olive oil mixed with fresh lemon juice and Loads of water. NOTHING!
Day 3: Monday 
Woke up went the loo worked on massaging each bum cheek had a small motion when I say small I mean the size of a pea. I was however able to pea (opps I mean pee) still rock hard impacted bum dripping with runny poo. 
I worked on each bum cheek rubbing and massaging as I sat on the loo for what seemed like most of the day gradually I was able to work most of it out as it became slightly softer.
Day 4: Tuesday
Woke up still unable to poo but weeing with ease when I needed to Bum cheeks felt normal (bit saggy as I'm getting older, I used to be such a fit tasty kind of guy with a great arse).  Today I am getting worried as I have never had anything like this happen to me I have always been fit and active never taking any time off.
I go on the internet and find this forum. After looking at loads of others
I am not anti-meds but only use them as a last resort if all else seems to fail. (I am a forth degree Reiki Master Practitioner and a black belt so fairly fit most of life) 
I remember my mother used Milk of Magnesia so after reading the comments here went and got some and took 15ml at 17:00 (I did read the instructions but decided to take some) my thinking was  before I go to bed wrong! Nothing happened so at 23:00 I took another 10ml and went bed.
Day5: Wednesday 
I awoke feeling as I had done for the last 4 days still wanting a poo  desperately wanting a poo and pissed off that the MOM had not worked yet. I sat on the loo had pee and and nothing!
Went outside to inflate my wife's car tyre which has a very slow puncture so got the compressor out attached it to the valve and as I bent over I thought to myself I think I need to go to the loo. So slowly walked back indoors (no urgency at all) sat on the loo and my bum exploded in an instant with such force that it truly stunned me OMG!
No pain. No cramp. No nothing; almost no sensation at all, except the most amazing feeling of not being full of poo (which I have been accused of on more than one occasion) (wrongly I have to say being a Leo apart from the last 5 poo filled days)
Been twice again since this morning it's now 14:15 and having just finished this felt I had to say is fanbloodytastic.
Be warned it can happen very very quickly and almost violently when it does, in my case without any warning and I'm happy to say without any pain or cramping at all (just lots and lots of noise and splashing and shouts from me (not of pain but of great relief. That must be the understatement of the year)
