Everything was going good until March of 2020 (no pun intended).  I received a bill for just under $3,000.00 for my prescription for one month.  I found out that there was an account set up by Dupixent that would basically cover not quite four months of their drug.  After that account is gone the consumer is hit with an unrealistic monthly bill.  If I had known this up front I would not of started on the medication.  I feel that I and my doctor where mislead on this product.  I have sent a letter to the company asking for help in paying this bill and I have heard no response.

Now however, for about the last 2 months, I have experienced the side effect on my eyes.  My eyelids are constantly red, inflamed, and itchy.  My eyes are constantly tearing.  My dermatologist gave me a prescription eye drop to take - it has not worked.  He said he does not think it is a side effect of dupixent, that he believes it is simply an eczema flair up, possibly due to the weather in New Jersey.  The dupixent people disagree - they think it is a side effect of dupixent.  So my dilemma is - do I stay on dupixent and continue the eye problems or go off dupixent.

It used to only affect small, isolated areas. I blame dupixent. I do not believe this drug is fully understood. I sincerely hope this is rare but it should be noted that before using dupixent and after using dupixent my eczema symptoms are extremely different. I never used to itch, and now I suffer from itch.

I started dupixent in July 2019. At first, I experienced major dry eye and a couple cold sores. These side effects only lasted a couple months and then completely resolved. My eczema completely cleared up within 2 weeks of use. Unfortunately as of lately, rashes have been coming back. I have mild spots on my wrists, fore arms and shoulders, but lately the rash has been absolutely brutal on my neck and jaws. I am hoping it is just the weather, but dupixent should not be allowing this to happen at all.
