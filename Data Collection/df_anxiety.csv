Started to take Lexapro. No side effects and it helped me a lot. Took it for 1 year and I started to change my lifestyle to have little to none stress.
2. 19 y.o. Stress came back and so did the anxiety. No panic attacks tho. Begun to take the med, started to enjoy things again. Had side effects this time. Gained 30 pounds over 8 months! Had EXTREME loss of libido. After one year and a half, I really can't say it did more good than bad this last time. I've been off it for 2 months now. I have insomnia and struggle to lose weight. I'm eating healthy on a C.D, exercising 6/w and yet I hardly lose any weight. I still have really dark thoughts when I go to sleep and overthinking are still there.

I've been bad before many times and never felt this kind of fear. It felt like my organs were shutting down. I couldn't scream. I couldn't breathe. I was deaf and blind, while sweat poured off me. Everything was paralyzed.    
It lasted a few minutes and I hyperventilated when it finally stopped as I had been unable to breathe that whole time.  The Dr told me it was a panic attack and to keep taking them. I said I couldn't and he said it's just a placebo anyways. He didn't believe my reaction and became angry with me.

The first week I had slight nausea, diarrhea and no appetite but I did start feeling more calm. Lexapro helped me so much. I could drive without feeling anxious, go to work events with confidence. I was better with handling situations at work and at home. Unfortunately the downside for me was I ended up gaining 15lbs within 5 months. It definitely slowed down my metabolism. It was easy to gain and no matter how much healthier I tried to eat I could not lose the weight. I have been slender my whole life so this was making me feel so depressed about the way I looked.

I was emotionally numb and had no empathy for others. 8 days in I started getting suicidal thoughts. Keep in mind I start this for anxiety and NOT depression/suicidal thoughts! I was very scared of myself as it felt like a second conscience was forming in my brain, one that'd tell me I'm worthless and ugly, and I'd argue with it with my normal conscience. 3 days into these new thoughts the more I was on it the more this depressive conscience took over, and I was forming ways on how to commit suicide.

Still, it took me at least a week to feel ‘normal’ again & that’s after only a single dose!  The half-life in this medication is extremely long.

I felt as I was going crazy and it left me on my bathroom floor moaning for days. Terrible terrible side effects.

I switched off Lexapro to try a new drug recently to see if it would work better, but it made my anxiety worse than ever. Thankfully I started Lexapro again last week and I already feel so much better.

I was lying on the bed and got a terribly dizzy, literally like I was on a boat, my room swinging right and left and all the time I had the feeling that I would fall because the dizziness became unmanageable.

I used to cry constantly, isolate myself, have panic attacks so frequently I couldn't even sleep, and have horrible intrusive violent thoughts. 
1. be proactive when it comes to the nausea side effect. Eat BEFORE you take the pill, and don't let yourself get hungry during the first 3-4 hours after you take the pill. Because once you get nausea it becomes harder to eat, which only makes you more nauseous. It's a vicious cycle that can be prevented.
2. ignore the negative reviews that are like ""I took this pill for 1 day and it caused *terrifying side effects*."" They only cause more anxiety and they're highly unlikely. 
3. From my personal experience, the first things to get better were the physical symptoms of anxiety. Less panic attacks, more hungry, less crying, etc. Keeping a journal is helpful to see the progression.”",Lexapro,Anxiety,243,353,41,oral

Before this medication, my OCD/BDD rituals and thoughts were consuming anywhere from 3-10 hours of my day. Since week 2 of this medication, the thoughts and rituals have been less and less. I'm on week 5, and I feel like it's helping more and more each day with anxious, obsessive thoughts and the down moods.

It helped with my anxiety and my depression wasn’t a big issue, but as I continued to take it, my depression slowly got worse and worse. I eventually stopped going to school and missed like 3 months worth of classes, being in college this was terrible, considering most classes only allow 3-5 absences for an entire semester. Needless to say, my grades went downhill causing me to fall deeper into my depression and never leave my house. Eventually I stopped taking it and while I’m still depressed and anxious, it’s not as bad as the Lexapro made it.

First and foremost EVERYONE is different, so everyone will react to it differently. I was prescribed it by my primary Doctor due to my severe anxiety and mild depression. Before this medication I was prescribed Celexa, but hated it. My anxiety and depression got so much worse I decided to do something about it. It came to the point where my anxiety and depression affected everyone around me and I just wasn't happy anymore.  At first taking this medication gave me some side affects. My side effects were really dry mouth, some intense dreams, and some loss of appetite. The only thing that has stuck for these few months have been the dreams. They seems SO REAL! But I can say I rather have some dreams than those scary anxiety attacks I use to get, and those depressed bed sobs. Lexapro has changed my life! Before this medication my life was hitting rock bottom. My Anxiety was so severe it took over my life. I obsessed over everything, overthought everything, felt like at any moment I was going to die. I was on edge every second. My blood pressure was always high and I'm only 24! I had this obsession of dying in a car accident, it came to a point I couldnt ride in a car with anyone else unless I was driving. If I did I would get panic attacks. My depression was also bad and also had an eating disorder. I felt like I was never going to be happy. Was never going to be happy in a relationship, or in my job, or even be able to hug my own mother again.

Do start at 5mg and slowly increase to 10 or 20mg. Ask you doctor to supplement with Buspar XL which counteracts most Lexapro side effects and further helps control anxiety and panic attacks.

At 10mg, anorgasmia was overcome after 14 days and at 20mg dose it took ANOTHER 35 days. I feel happier, more patient, less obsessive, and with reduced anxiety. Side effects now are: mild tinnitus, mild muscle tension in stomach and nightly bathroom run. My advice: Be VERY patient and get your brain chemicals stabilized before you worry about the sex.

This lasted until I finally withdrew from it. (Spent 12 days in a Behavorial health unit) from trying to manage the withdrawl. It even prompted my septum to deviate which I'm dealing with now. ( extremely frustrating)

I'm off all pyschiatric medication now. I'm the happiest I've ever been, my appetite is best it's ever been and my weight is normalizing. My anxiety is normal. I've learned to manage my feelings through sleeping, eating well and being socialable

I have anxiety and panic disorder.

All the non-drug options were helpful but not sufficient. SSRIs were not very effective in my case and I had various side effects.  Benzodiazepines worked brilliantly and helped me through some stressful months of training but led to pharmacological tolerance and dependence.  After many years of struggling with no medications I decided to try buspirone but I was very skeptical it would work because most of my colleagues stated it was a rather ineffectual drug.  I have to say they are absolutely wrong.  I feel calmer, more in control than I have been for a long time.”",Buspirone,Anxiety,87,339,2,oral

Even more serious of a problem with Xanax in particular is its rebound effects that make the symptoms WORSE than before.

It saved my life because I nearly had a nervous breakdown from worrying about my family and the bad conditions in our country. Thanks to Xanax I am still here. Most of those who have issues are taking way to much too many times a day. Taking just .25 is all I need to sleep better.

I would say Xanax can be like magic when you feel like you're going through debilitating anxiety and have frequent panic attacks, but it is a quick fix and should be used as a short-term treatment while finding a long-term treatment, because I can see how physical and psychological dependency can easily develop - if the issue isn't addressed and use is frequently continued.

Stopping my Xanax like I wanted to do the first day - just stop taking them - is dangerous my Doctor said that would not be possible, since I actually could die from it. So instead it is a slow painful reduction of dosage day after day.

I suffer with all the usual anxiety symptoms, but one symptom that is most annoying is the choking sensation I feel in my throat. I believe I carry my stress and worries there. When I take Xanax, it takes this terrible feeling away. I find it extremely difficult to get a doctor to prescribe me this medicine as I moved to another state.

It can make you a little sleepy. I think for 'normal people' it would make them very sleepy. For 'anxious' people, I think it makes you normal and relaxed.

The one problem is that if you take it too much, like three days in a row, the effect is reduced and you have to 'up' the dosage.

The first few times I took it, it made me very tired but eventually that stopped happening- it makes it easy for me to fall asleep but not overly tired, and I’m not groggy in the morning. I have had to take it during the day for extreme anxiety or panic attacks and sometimes it slows me down a little but nothing crazy. I’m in recovery from drug addiction, so narcotic anxiety meds were not an option for me. I am so thankful I found this medication because it really helps me but doesn’t really give me any side effects. The one thing that I don’t like is that it makes me dizzy if I take it on an empty stomach, but usually I’ll just take it with a granola bar or yogurt and that’s enough to keep the dizziness at bay.”",Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,80,439,5,oral

Pros:
- Very effective
- Works quickly
- Safe
- Doesn't make you drowsy
- Can be taken as needed; not addictive and no withdrawls
- Doesn't impair cognitive function
- Also helps with allergies!
Cons:
- Primary side effects were dizziness and weight gain
Notes:
- I've found from personal experience that if I take it before bed I'm more likely to have nightmares
- Do not quickly get up: slowly stand up, else you'll get extremely dizzy and might even fall over.
- Do not take with other antihistamines: always check with your doctor or a pharmacist before taking allergy medicine.

It works very well for chronic anxiety disorder and  sudden onsets of severe panic attacks. Knowing what I know now, I wish with all my being it had never ever been prescribed to me, and without the absurd nonchalance dozens of practitioners have portrayed. 
I'm 32 and have been prescribed clonazopam for 14 years. Ive been in situations where my health insurance is in transition and I must go off the medication abruptly-- this is when I realized how deep I was. Weeks upon weeks of non stop physical, emotional, and psychological withdrawal effects that are like hell. Words cannot accurately describe just how awful it is. This, again, has been my experience during withdrawal as a long term clonazopam patient. 
All skin, especially the face, becomes numb. Vision gets fuzzy and difficult to see clearly. Panic attacks become extremely exasperated, frequent and debilitating. Severe irritability. Worst of all: a terrifying disconnection between your mind and body; as if you're an onlooker watching and feeling this horrible thing happen to you, but not actually feeling connected to any of it-- that one is tough to explain. All of this... It can lasts months, maybe more. That's right. Not just some one week hump to overcome. 
After finding how awful the withdrawal is I've been attempting to ween very very slowly down from 3 2mg doses per day to eventually zero, hopefully. After six months of gradually decreases in dose I'm now at 2- 1mg doses per day and I'm not sure how or if I can go much less than that. No doctors I've had have been of any help. The ween down was my idea and the rate of it was also my idea based on experience. It sure would be nice to meet a doctor that truly had knowledge of this withdrawal syndrome and took it a bit more seriously. I am confident that the medication is no longer treating my anxiety disorder, but simply preventing withdrawal from the meds themselves. And there don't seem to be any good alternatives. It's a long road ahead, please think it over and over with someone knowledgeable before being so quick to embrace this miracle drug. The truth is that most of us actually need very real psychotherapy, not chemicals that run our lives.

Not only that, withdrawal from this drug is miserable and painful if not done currently and under supervision.

Any mammal reducing or discontinuing certain drugs, like Ativan, can experience dependence, characterized by physical and emotional distress at withdrawal. This is should NOT alone be considered ADDICTION. Addiction often involves dependence, but that's not all. If you discontinue Ativan and find yourself drinking uncharacteristically more, or pursuing other chemical ways to cope, you may have a valid addiction concern.  Phy./emo. dependence, is not the only criteria for AdXN. Dr's are generally accepting of this and should take no offence.

Even at the minimal dosage, using this stuff daily for even a week will cause problems.  Namely - it CAUSES anxiety.  From what I've read this is a dependence that develops - either (or both) physical or mental. After only a few times you get accustomed to it ""fixing"" your situation.  Your body adjusts for the GABA boost, and then ""crashes"" - resulting in anxiety.  Very bad loop to get in.  Warning signs: you're counting the # hours the med will still be working (about 6 total), you're watching the clock for when you might be able to take another pill, you always carry a pill in your pocket, etc. Those are bad signs.”",Lorazepam,Anxiety,27,297,32,oral

Even more serious of a problem with Xanax in particular is its rebound effects that make the symptoms WORSE than before.

Xanax is more addictive than heroin and turns normal people into weird and angry shells of who they previously were.
The drug causes the brain to stop producing chemicals it needs and the half life is so short that you go into withdrawal every time the drug “runs out” every 4 hours. You believes the feeling is “anxiety” and take another pill to treat it! However the feeling is just withdrawal. You will need more and more of the drug just to get the original effects and you will not really be aware of how you’re acting. The longer you take the drug the worse it gets- and eventually the doctor who got you hooked on it will stop prescribing it.
A safe way to get off of Xanax is the Ashton method  (Benzodiazepines

5460,10,"March 31, 2017",, 151,"“Gabapentin has really helped me with anxiety. I used to always be thinking of what I had to do while I was busy with something else.  For example, I would worry about what I had to do after work while I was at work.  I would play future scenarios over and over before they even occurred. I would play past experiences over and over.  Some call this rumination.  Much of this has either dropped down to a manageable level or just disappeared with gabapentin. I have never been one much into pharmaceuticals but this one works for me.  I can see that some people love how it works for them, some people despise of it, and others say it doesn't do a thing for them. We are all different and what works for one doesn't work for another, just like diet.
I'm much happier going out and doing ordinary things like shopping, going to the bank, and other ordinary routine tasks.  I easily get bored with ordinary tasks and just want to get them done.  I just wanted to get things over with so that I could take on the next task. Now, I can be more with what I am doing without having to rush through it to get to the next goal. I take my time and stop to talk with people.  It's ok if I'm late for the next task so long as it's not an appointment where others are involved.  The main thing for me is to enjoy people when I go out to a store, or the bank, or wherever!  The gabapentin helps a part of my brain slow down so that I can ""see"" the people in my day.  
It really feels good to go to the gym and not feel tied to a specific exercise routine anymore. I like going in with a goal in mind, but allow for what the body is telling me.  Instead of just checking in at the desk, I'm more likely to spend time saying hello and having patience. So what if it means that I will get home 5 minutes later and eat dinner 5 minutes later, and then get 5 minutes less sleep. Big deal!  I see from writing this that gabapentin helps me to be less obsessive
With gabapentin, it is much easier for me to accept doing a job I am tired of. I've been at the same job for a long job and was getting antsy to move on. There isn't anything bad about the job, but doing anything ""forever"" gets kind of old. Now, I know that soon I will be making a change, but can be""more"" patient until the change happens. If I were completely patient, then the change would never happen. There is still fire to make the change happen. I feel less anxiety about change and welcome it more now. There are times in life when change is good.  I don't feel as dead in my tracks with fearing change. It's  o.k. if I don't figure out ""everything"" today because there is always tomorrow!

Recently been found to be closest to body's natural neurotransmitters compared to other benzos. You can get addicted to any drug. I've tried many antidepressants. Bad side effects.  Terrible side effects.  Look at risperdal. If I have a headache I take some tylenol or motrin and 9 time out of 10 my headache goes away. I can take an drug that they tell me might take 2 weeks or longer to start working. Maybe. If I'm having a panic attack I can't wait 2 weeks. I need something that works quickly. And if I have a seizure I don't wanna wait weeks for that either. I consider this drug like my insulin. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder among other  things and I have taken seizures before. Valium works best for me. 5mg in the morning and I am productive and fine for 8 to 10 hours.

I recommend not using Valium for more than two days in a row, otherwise you will get addicted, and Valium is a nightmare to get off of if you are addicted. You will need to slow taper off of it if you have been taking this long-term, and this can take months or years. Check out Benzo Buddies for the horror stories.

I personally, was previously on Lorazepam for serious anxiety. Even though I was on in for several months, addiction or overdose was never a problem for me.

Just don't enjoy eating the way many people do.  And stress or if I have any reason to be nervous - that makes it even harder to eat.  Anyway, I've found this medicine helps a lot.  I take probably 1-2 mg (tiny pieces of my 15mg pill) once a week.  I have been able to gain weight, and whenever I fall into the rut of not knowing what to eat (for days on end), this boosts my appetite enough to pull me out of that spot.  It also helps with my anxiety.  It does dry my sinuses significantly, but I just run a humidifier in my room at night and that fixes the dry-sinus issue.”",Mirtazapine,Anxiety,125,460,3,oral

Apparently, this is what causes the carb cravings. So, I dropped the carbs. It was a tough 2 weeks, but RESULT! Zero craving and rather than gaining weight, I am loosing. I gained three stones on the Cit, so that's even better news. I thought that I had to choose between being fat and happy or thin and crazy. Instead, my choice is between carbohydrates or protein. It's important to make sure to get good a multivitamin that includes minerals. Also, eat plenty of green leafy veg (after transition).

All I can say is I slept really well but continued to feel sluggish and tired during the day. Took 2nd one last night before bed. Woke and had cuppa around 7.30 then slept till 9.30. Got up has cereal and figured I was still sleepy so went back to bed. I didn't wake until 1.30!!! Surely this cannot be normal. Is it? I'm scared to keep going with them if I'm going to end up sleeping the days away. Any advice? Anybody experienced same/similar at very start?”",Mirtazapine,Anxiety,125,460,3,oral

Also another side effect I had for around the first 1.5 months was increased appetite I could eat and eat and eat and I would still feel like I could continue eating. There wasn’t a point that I knew that I was satiated.  At around 3 months I started to feel like my anxiety levels were normalising I began to feel more like myself and could see through the mist.
