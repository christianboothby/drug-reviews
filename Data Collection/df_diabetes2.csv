Hard to sleep. A couple of nights this week I awoke with terrible stomach pain. I went to feel my belly and it was as hard as a rock. Passing inconsistent stools and feeling somewhat constipated at times. I thought medication was supposed to help a person feel BETTER, not worse.

No apparent side effects from Trulicity except gaining 3-4 pounds and having ""pebble"" bowel motions which, after a few days, turns to urgent needs but not diarrhea. My same meter now shows blood glucose levels regularly 280+ and sometimes 400+. A1c has increased too.
I have injected via belly and thighs. No difference but sometimes I wonder if any fluid was actually injected. Today I firmly placed the syringe near the top of my thigh, pressed the button and waited. I felt no ""squirt"" and the click came very quickly in 1-2 seconds. No tiny blood speck. No overflow drop.

Now, once a week and a hidden needle it is very very easy now.
So far I have not experienced any of these other symptoms except a brief feeling of nausea. Nothing really bad at all.

One other benefit is appetite suppression, physically and mentally (if that's a thing). I actually went on this drug first for weight loss. It makes it so that I don't think about food at all. I don't get as hungry either. This naturally helps to lose weight.

I have become insulin resistant so my consultant has put me on victoza to help regulate my high bloods and also to aid weight loss.

Dr suggested Victoza and we started adjusting it as directed. By the time he got at 1.8 the symptoms were unbearable. Sick, nausea no appetite. We decided to bring it down to 1.2.  He was still feeling slight discomfort and I told him to take it right before bed. This change has made his quality of life 100% better! He’s so happy and feeling better than he has in years! He’s only been on it for 2 months and A1C is down around 6-7. We are afraid of the long term side effects and will ask Dr since this drug is supposed to help your body promote insulin, first, can he lower it even more and how long is he expected to be on this drug.

It doesn't cause cancer it causes low blood pressure (pg) when given IV press in a fast manner. (Read a book).

With regard to food, I eat smaller, choose better/more balanced food, I have lost around 10kg in total in this time and this alone has made a huge difference. I also consume pre/probiotics daily now and this helped with the GI disturbances.

As for side effects, I had nausea, dizzy spells, gut ache/cramps, reflux, felt rather tired in the first 2 weeks. All dissipated in the first 4 weeks. At the time I told myself I prefer to feel like this in the short term than head into a future potentially suffering from the plethora of illness brought about by Type 2 Diabetes.

Little to no side effects overall.  Some stomach issues like constipation, bloating but can’t rule out dietary changes being the cause also.  Went on a low carb diet and really stuck to it for once and increased exercise a lot.   Use of the Freestyle Libre Sensor really really helped too!

Coke Zero cravings are completely gone. I still have one in a great eon.  Food appetite is down. I do take more naps than usual, but I believe that is from the reduced food intake.

I'm a type 1 diabetic and my doctor has been prescribing Ozempic 'off license' and it has really been working well for his patients.

My doctor thinks I'm taking too much insulin and my A1c has been quite high the last 5 years so he wanted me to try this. 

The annoying thing is it's worked so well. I've lost loads of weight and my blood sugars are basically perfect but the side effects are getting worse. 

I was meant to go up to 0.5 but I was too sick. 

I take my injection on a Wednesday night. The whole next two days I'm nauseated and find it really hard to get out of bed. 

Then Friday night, sat and Sunday is horrible. Terrible pain in my stomach, cramps all night to the point where I can't sleep at all, and diarrhea. 

This weekend I took immodium really fast but I was actually in the most pain yet. I thought I needed to go to hospital it was so bad.

I have been taking Bydureon for about 30 months alongside Metformin and Jardiance.  I have lost weight and I'm now down to 92kg (202 lbs for those in the USA), that's about 10kg since I started taking weekly Bydureon.
I find it makes me feel full most of the time and I sometimes get constipation but my results are quite good.  My HbA1c has dropped and I've managed to keep off insulin for now.
I wonder if one of the main ways of how it works is that the weight loss can restore my own insulin production rather than the drug itself.
All medication for Diabetics is free here so I'm unaware how much it costs and we are treated with the medication that most suited to us - irrelevant of the price.

I have had positive results but they would be much better if I didn't cheat so much. I have had several injections that bled like crazy after I injected it.

I don't like that when you shake it some does come out of the needle and some leaks out after injections.  But I guess that it gives me what I need.

Take the injection out of the fridge at least 30 minutes prior to mixing and injecting it mixes better and doesn't hurt to inject.
Take an anti-nausea to medication 30 minutes prior to the injection and take the injection at night before you go to bed.

It lowered my Blood Sugar and my Blood Pressure. I did not lose weight as some do (which I suspect is mostly water weight from urinating more).  I had to stop my blood pressure medicine because I felt I was bottoming out with both meds (Invokana was lowering my blood pressure too). 

But now that I have been taking Invokana, since it was available, I just recently stopped it due to not being able to handle the side effects anymore. I feel so FATIQUED ALL the time. My muscles ache once I get to the top of my stairs. I am out of breath and feel like I have run a marathon. My chest would feel tight and just felt faint all the time when doing anything! Add life's stresses (job) to that, and it made me so miserable!!

And, I have been working out 4 days a week since Jan!! It is so frustrating. I am also on week 4 of a nothing but veggie and some fruit smoothies (no meat, wheat, and only dairy is whole fat Greek yogurt). So I figured since I was having to watch my blood sugars more closely, since they were lower with this new eating plan, now was a good time to quit the Invokana. I am hoping within a week I might feel like my old self again. Due to doing EVERYTHING I can to HELP my Diabetes, and I still felt bad, I knew it had to be my Invokana. The only other med I take is Lantis SolarStar. 

I started to get worried about long term effects of Invokana, especially since I was doing what anyone with health issues should do (exercise and eat super healthy), and still felt fatigued, I decided to do more research online and have found MANY others with my SAME and worse side effects. Many complain of constant yeast infections (both women and men), hair loss, swelling of lymph nodes to where they did STD tests and cancer screening, shortness of breath, fatigue, urinary tract infections, bladder infections, kidney issues (some really bad). I got scared reading so many many bad reviews. I don't want to end up with major kidney problems!!

So I am going to do what every Type II Diabetic should do, and actually EAT HEALTHY and EXERCISE!! We are switching to organic foods and plan to continue drinking these green smoothies for 2 meals a day and have a reasonable dinner. We need to lose weight anyways. That will ensure we get tons of veggies and fruits and so much nutrition that we would otherwise be deficient in. We keep track of all our calories to ensure we get enough protein, and healthy fat etc. I also take some supplements, super foods, and vitamins made with whole food. We are going to stop all soda, sugar, artificial sweeteners, and pre-made and highly processed foods, as best we can...it will be a process, lol. . I am so mad at all that is put in our food, I can't believe it is legal!!. Most chronic type diseases are due to inflammation in the body and what we PUT in our bodies. Healthy in, healthy out. Crap in, crap out. You ARE what you eat. Stop putting chemicals and toxins in your body. Stop eating food that is not raised/cultivated naturally healthy. Eat whole food and ""clean"" foods.

She said it's basically like peeing sugar which in turn causes the yeast to grow. I think some of you that are having serious issues with yeast, might be trying to eat whatever you want and expecting the pill to take care of it.

The constant itching and thrush can be off putting but I found when I ate lower carb the symptoms decreased.

Also I order Clotrimazole online very cheaply and use when needed to keep on top of a flare up.

When I eat badly the urinating and itching is worse as there’s more sugar to pee out.

(sorry for any guys on this) the reason why the UTI and vaginal irritation occur is the drug is causing glucose (SUGAR) to leave your body through the urine.

But lets look at the actual clinical trials. 
Januvia reduces A/1c by .8 percent or less than 1 percent. What does that actually mean? If you have an A/1C of 7.5 before Januvia, expect 7.44 after taking Januvia. Not impressive at all considering the cost and minor side effects.”",Januvia,Diabetes (Type 2),2,244,24,oral
