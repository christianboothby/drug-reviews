Then I developed this cough and my feet became painfully swollen. I kept taking the meds because I never linked it to that. Then my husband saw my feet and asked in a concerned why are your feet so swollen. Well then I knew something wasn't right. I started to think ok what is different and when did I start getting the swollen. Answer not sure but very recently. What else is recent? I have been taking the XYZAL for about 2 months. So I stopped taking it as of yesterday. My feet are still swollen but if it is the drug then stopping it will cause the swollen to go down. If it isn't the drug then I guess a visit to the doc is in order.”,Levocetirizine,Allergies,0,239,2,oral

I took a whole pill last night around 9pm and I’ll tell you what! I took a shower before bed and while I was in the shower I thought I was going to fall out right there! I mustered you the strength and collapsed in my bed with my towel still on. It is 5pm the next day and I can’t move. It’s like morphine. That’s the only way I can describe it. My boyfriend took half a pill last night and he’s still sleeping. Oh but my allergies are better today.

It helped with my allergies and stuffy nose. After that I noticed my urine turned orange. I thought it was the effect of an antibiotic I was taking, so the dr told me to stop taking the antibiotic. Urine still remained dark after that. Then a cough began that I have had for at least 3 weeks. The final straw was when my face started breaking out with a rash and then my leg. I never thought the medication was the cause of all this until I read reviews from others. I have experienced the depression, the cough, the rash, the dark urine, the fatigue, so now I'm going to stop taking it and hope I can clear up all of these issues. I would say don't take this drug.

I’m usually skeptical of reading people’s reviews and not trying a medication because of it, but I wish I had. I have never experienced nightmares so awful in my entire life. The amount of anxiety I feel right now is beyond words. Still have a stuffy nose as well. Honestly wondering if I had a panic attack in my sleep.

The first week of taking XYZAL at night before bed, I was so tired the next day I could hardly function and I had a really bad upper stomach ache. But it helped my allergies so well I stuck with it. Eventually the tiredness and stomach ache got better but it seems to take longer to kick in and wears off more quickly now with my allergy symptoms reappearing well before it's time to take another dose.

Sudafed pain and pressure helped make the headaches go away but did nothing for the other conditions that sinus and allergies bring along. I work in a warehouse so I'm constantly exposed to the weather, dust and dirt. So I saw a commercial for xyzal. I figured I'd give it a try. Went and picked up a pack of it and it wasn't cheap. I instantly noticed a difference. Over time I didn't get the headaches I once did. If I did get a sinus infection I cleared it out in a third of the time I normally would.

I usually go off it 4 months out of the year, and haven't noticed a change when I do, so maybe the side-effects do not happen to everyone.

I suffer from seasonal allergies and most over the counter medicines work, but have limited and sometimes almost no effect. Hydroxyzine was prescribed to me for a skin condition but I quickly realized that I didn't sneeze or sniffle for upwards of 3 days on one 25mg dose. 

The side effects for me are heavy drowsiness when combined with alcohol or a few nights inadequate night sleep (where I would normally be ""ok"" with coffee). Sometimes taking it before bed helps, sometimes it doesn't. 

I also feel removed and emotionless on occasion. These feeling gets worse the longer I am on the medication.  I don't get sad or happy - it's weird.”",Hydroxyzine,Allergies,80,439,5,oral
