0,9,"October 24, 2020",, 1,For Chlamydia Infection:			“My boyfriend slept with so many girls before we start dating and so when we started our relationship we also got active in sex without using protection I was only on birth control. Then I was seeing the doctor because I always had painful sex which came out to be vaginismus and when the doctor took me a test they also found out that I had chlamydia. I felt ashamed of myself and I had to tell my boyfriend that he needs to get checked up.  My doctor sent me 2 tablets of chlamydia 500mg to take at once. I took it before eating and then I ate a lot and drunk plenty of water. That was yesterday and I have not had any side effects so far. I was even able to travel from OH to KY. So far so good.

Doxycycline has always been a super effective drug for my lung infections. It can cause some intense gastro-intestinal upset (especially reflux) if you are not careful about it. For best results take with food and make sure you take it with plenty of water. I took it once and because I did not drink enough water,  it dissolved in my esophagus and caused a burn and ulcer there. It was so painful. A very effective drug though for bronchitis.

Last week (I figured I'd give it a second try), I took 1 dose of Augmentin before bed and ended up in the ER about 4 1/2 hours later with a full body rash (after only 1 dose!).  My skin was on fire.  Purple blotches all over.  Stomach upset. Back pain.  Spent the next 3 days with a terrible rash and hives.  Turns out I'm allergic to anything penicillin based (amoxicillin).  I'm sure it's a very good/strong antibiotic for those that can tolerate it, but if you've had any type of an adverse reaction in the past, whether stomach upset or rash, etc., I'd highly advise staying away.  Could be that you have an actual allergy and that it's not just a bad side effect of the drug.  Stick with Levaquin!”",Augmentin,Bronchitis,9,45,8,oral
