First, discuss this concern with your doctor. No medication will work if you can't afford to pay for it!
Or to take smaller doses so you don't have to shell out $ you don't have. 
I would recommend checking with the manufacturer for discounts, or sometimes getting a medication at no cost.

If I sit up in bed or get up, the pain goes away in about 20 minutes. The problem is that I cannot sleep sitting up and, off course I can't do without sleep.

I am able to take Nucynta for breakthrough pain once or twice a day. My baseline pain reliever is Ultram ER 300mg.

4177,1,"February 20, 2009",, 23,“Went to the ER because of sciatic nerve pressure for severe pain and multiple muscles spasms that would not stop. 2 injections of dilaudid had no effect at all. Tried some 4mg oral dilaudid tablets and no effect at all. This is most likely a very effective pain reliever but this indicates that not all pain relievers work on me. Doctors don't believe me so I almost always refuse to take any pain medication. I think I need to be studied.”,Dilaudid,Pain,116,277,1,oral

Percocet, Darvocet and Vicodin upset my stomach, so I've only been on Lodine 2x day for the past two years.  My doctor suggested a trial on Dilaudid - 2mg to 4mg every 4-6 hours until I can have a knee replacement.  2mg did not make me pain-free, but definitely was an improvement.  However, 4mg allowed me to walk without pain for the first time in months. It makes me sleepy, but aside from that there have been no unpleasant side effects.  Dilaudid is a wonder drug for anyone who experiences chronic pain.”",Dilaudid,Pain,116,277,1,oral

on my rectum, and I get complete relief from four milligrams taken by mouth. The sole side effect appears to be a degree of sleepiness, but compared to other drugs of similar potency, this one seems to induce minimal impairment.  The horrors (hallucinations) are readily controlled by a small amount of valium.”",Dilaudid,Pain,116,277,1,oral

It was hard to get perscribed in pill form but finally found a pain doctor that agreed it was a better drug for me. I now take 4mg pills every 6-8 hours and can lead a normal life. There are no side effects, but it is hard to get a script for. Take only as doctor says, DO NOT take more.”",Dilaudid,Pain,116,277,1,oral

If 2mg don't help, I take the other half of the pill for a total of 4mg.  I take the dilaudid in combination with MS Contin.  Like many others have said, I have tried many other pain medications and dilaudid is the ONLY thing that helps me with my pain.  Morphine does not help (it makes me very sick - although the long acting MS Contin is ok).

When the pills are not able to control my pain, or after surgery I take IV dilaudid, and this is the best pain medication.  There have been times I've been curled in a ball in tears the pain has been so bad and this works instantly.”",Dilaudid,Pain,116,277,1,oral

I also take it in conjuction with 30mg of Oxycontin ER. I can actually get out of bed and do something. Be advised though that withdrwals could be severe.

Without it I would have a constant pain level of 8 to 9.5 and unable to do anything. With it my pain level runs 4 to 6 and I'm able to do some things.
