After years of being misdiagnosed, I was given Singulair.  Within 4 weeks, I no longer needed my nebulizer or rescue inhalers.  
I gradually became more tired, and extremely agitated. I began hearing voices in my own home and I live alone.  It got worse, not better.  One night, I was convinced someone was in my home. Every light in the house was on. I still kept seeing someone!
Coming from a military background, and secure in owning firearms, I was searching my home with a gun. 
I was looking for an intruder who was NOT there! 
That was my final straw. I threw my Singulair in the garbage. I’m still agitated and frustrated. I am going to try over the counter medication deemed safe. 
I’m not sure how long the agitation and tiredness will last.  I pray this will help someone.  Please be careful on this medicine. For me, it’s not worth it.

I write this review because I want everyone to realize the possibility. I have been off of the drug for nearly a month now and I’m back to normal!

After taking montelukast  for seven months or so, the medication simply lost its effect completely. I was back on the rescue inhaler. The inhaler increases the chances of contracting bacterial infections like bronchitis and pneumonia, especially when used heavily.
