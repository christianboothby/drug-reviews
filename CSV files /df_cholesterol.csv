Well turns out after doing more research into these toxic drugs I was indeed being slowly poisoned. Stopped after 9 days and things are improving slowly.

These drugs stop the essential HMG-CoA pathway in the body which produces many molecules that are essential for cellular health. They also build up in muscle tissue in their toxic lactone form. This is especially serious if you have an acidic blood pH. There are genetic variations in the bodies ability to clear these through the liver that can lead to a dangerous build-up of these drugs in your body. This basic biology is all hard science and confirmed by peer-reviewed studies.

Educate yourself and make your own decision before letting your doctor scare you into taking these dangerous drugs.”",Atorvastatin,Cholesterol,41,235,33,oral

I wanted to get that up front so it didn't get lost in a story that sounds like others.  I took 6 injections (140mg every 2 weeks) of Repatha from June to Sept. 2019.  I was active before taking this drug, but the pain in my hips progressed until I could hardly walk.  I went to a massage therapist and she said the muscles in my hip and glutes felt like brick.  It took 20 minutes just to separate the muscles enough to start to work on them.  After an hour of deep tissue massage I walked out feeling SO much better.  It was painful, but totally worth it and I could feel that the pain was hitting exactly the right spots.  That just happened today so I can't say how long it will last, but for now I'm more comfortable than I've been in some time.

I was active before taking this drug, but the pain in my hips progressed until I could hardly walk.  I went to a massage therapist and she said the muscles in my hip and glutes felt like brick.  It took 20 minutes just to separate the muscles enough to start to work on them.  After an hour of deep tissue massage I walked out feeling SO much better.  It was painful, but totally worth it and I could feel that the pain was hitting exactly the right spots.  That just happened today so I can't say how long it will last, but for now I'm more comfortable than I've been in some time.

After 4 shots of Repatha 140 mg. my cholesterol went from 250 to 160;  LDL 187 to 114; HDL 41 to 49.  

I read most of the reviews and see some patients reporting negative reviews!  I too was having some problems at first.. but then I started to use an App called   CronOMeter  which allowed me to keep track of my daily Fats, carbohydrates, and Protein I was eating on a daily basis!  

I found as long as I keep my daily Fat grams intake equal to my carbohydrates and protein grams combined, I do not experience any side affects!  

This is called a Low carb diet.  

What I would like ALL heart patients to know is it essential that you are fully aware of Fats, carbohydrates, and Protein grams you have in your body at all times and include that in your review of using Repatha!

For example on a daily basis I consume 140 grams of Fats, 80 grams of Protein and 60 grams of Carbohydrates.

I had muscle pain, developed carpal tunnel, foot swelling and numbness, from statins. I also noticed a decrease in brain function and memory. While I had the numb feet and swelling , I twisted my left foot going down the steps. After 5 months and 5 different statins I was taken off of statins. Each time I changed statins , I had a few good weeks with no symptoms between the different statin types. All symptoms  disappeared. My therapy was going well, I was walking without a cane, walking on a treadmill 45 minutes a day, biking on stationary bike for 15 minutes a day and taking classes and working out at they 3 days a week.

The injections are easy but its key to allow it to warm up fully to high end of room temp to allow it to thin out and inject easier. I took the other Praluent for about 5 months with similar results.

However, blood tests from the last few years have revealed that I have a problem with high cholesterol and triglycerides.  Eight weeks ago, when my triglyceride number was a shocking 583 and LDL over 200, my doctor insisted that I needed some help to bring these numbers into a healthy range.  Reluctantly, I agreed.  I was prescribed 20mg of Crestor daily at bedtime.  It scared me to death to read reviews on Crestor and statin drugs in general and I almost didn't even give it a chance but also committed to making some changes in lifestyle.  For example, I started skipping most of the sweet, fatty foods and actually paying attention to serving sizes and TRYING to stick closer to recommended allowances.  I have also been going on brisk, half-hour walks at least 5 days a week.  Nothing tremendously difficult but something that has required consistency.  After eight weeks of using Crestor and living a little differently, I am happy to report that my Triglycerides are now down to a mere 67 and my LDL level is down to 57.  I’ve also lost 15lbs and I wasn’t overweight to begin with.  I expected the numbers to show improvement but I was shocked to see them this good!  What's more is that I have not noticed any of the negative side effects mentioned by so many.  Trust me, I was looking out for those for any excuse to stop taking it.  I will mention a positive side effect I was not expecting.  I've been burdened with IBS (irritable Bowel Syndrome) for many years.  I've just lived with it and been careful about how long I might be away from a bathroom.  Interestingly enough, since I have been on Crestor, I have been much more regular and, well, solid.  Maybe that is TMI but I have appreciated the change.
