I can’t even look at myself in the mirror anymore, trust me I’d rather have acne than lose my hair. Now it’s made me more insecure.

Side effects:
- dry lips - you have to CONSTANTLY have your lips covered in a layer of chapstick or vaseline (specifically for lips). Otherwise, your lips will immediately begin to peel and crack. If you're covered, you should be 100% fine. 
- dry eyes - after the second month, I would wake up 99% of the time with my eyes shut together. No crust or goop or anything like that. Just the rims of my eyelids shut together and it sometimes would make them a little sore when I'd take my fingers to force them open. 
- nosebleeds - out of the blue, I have woken up coughing up blood from a nosebleed draining to the back of my throat. Usually they would occur when I blow my nose or some minor impact to my nose. Usually occurs every couple of weeks.”",isotretinoin,Acne,19,82,0,oral

I took accutane for 6 months and yes it cleared my skin completely but at what cost? My skin was pink/red, dry & extremely sensitive to sunlight. 12 months after I came off accutane my acne returned exactly as it was before. Not only that but I now suffer from rosacea, I cannot tan especially on my face, I have a red face all the time & I blush when drinking. I never had severe acne and honestly wish I had never taken this medication as the side-effects are worse than the initial acne.

My worst side effects were lower back pain, dry skin, and dry eyes. These side effects went away after I finished. I highly recommend taking Accutane. Although it is hard having your skin be bad for a couple months straight, it is definitely worth it. One thing they don't really tell you about is the blood work and pregnancy test you have to do once a month before getting your new packet for that month.

Started to notice a huge difference in my skin on month 2. Treatment is very harsh with many side effects. Dry and thin skin, breakouts now and then, very dry eyes. I tried all type of blistex lip balms which did not help. Baseline blueseal works wonders on the lips and even on dry area ok the skin. I apply sun screen everyday with nutraderm lotion to hydrate my skin. I also find that it really helps to have at least 3 litres of water everyday.

I'm currently in the middle of month 3 of treatment and the past few weeks have been the hardest. Skin and lips is dryer than ever and loss of hair. Some days depression kicks in so it is important to keep your loved ones around you just to have some positivity.

This treatment is quite costly but it is all worth it at the end. A few months of side effects and praying the price for a life long great skin and confident you.”",isotretinoin,Acne,19,82,0,oral

Of course some will need a higher dosage than others or longer period of time depending on how bad the acne is. I was on a one pill per day option for 4 months. Within 2 months most of my pimples had cleared and only had spots. I was happy. But the side effects are also not very pretty. But I think it is a small price to pay for clearer skin forever. I had really dry lips. Had to drink water all the time. I actually used to sleep with a bottle and some vaseline to use during night. My whole body was extremely dry including my private parts. Had small nosebleeds. But I'd try to put vaseline with an earbud in my nose to avoid drying up. My face was very sensitive.

I came to accept myself in college and for awhile I thought it was immoral/dangerous to risk accutane because I had depression in high school. However, over the years I learned that several of my classmates and my own cousin had taken it and look normal. When I started my first job while living at home right after college I decided it was time to roll the dice with accutane. I’m in a special category of people because I decided that I was willing to own the risk just for the chance to try this drug and see if it opens some doors for me. I also wanted the assurance that this was something I could recommend to my future child.

I had dime sized blisters on my body from a sunburn. 6 months: body aches that made it difficult to sleep, poor digestion, hemorrhoids, bloody stools, & sad.  Months 7-9: MY HAIR FELL OUT.

I was on this drug for a total of 8 months and had side effects such as constipation in the beginning, some occasional joint pain when I would lie down or get up, a few styes, and VERY severe, frequent nosebleeds that were very annoying. I wouldn’t recommend trying this medication if you haven’t been on anything else before yet for cystic acne, but if you’ve already tried everything and you’re at the end of your rope, try it!

Any cream would burn my skin. My aunt suggested Accutane. I had a few side affects from the tablets but not much result. But on month 4 I would say, I saw my skin start to clear up quite quickly, but my emotional state started to deteriorate. I suffered with mild anxiety and depression. 8 months later and my skin was amazing. I got constant compliments about how much better my skin was. I stopped the tablets in October, and unfortunately my skin has started to go back to its old ways, so I’m disappointed about that. I think a longer treatment may have benefited me.

Month two was not too bad either, some headaches, and more dryness on the lips and body. Month three is when some of the emotional instability kicked in. I have been experiencing some anxiety and depression, but it's been manageable. The irritation and more anger has been the worst emotional side effects. I've also noticed thinning of the skin, more easily to injure and more noticeable veins. Over all I still believe taking accutane has been worth it.

However as the months continued in my treatment, I began to develop cystic acne around my shoulder and back, so bad in fact that they would burst and bleed causing agonising pain for the best part of 3 months. These cysts would later leave me keloid scars I still have to this day. However after my course, it seemed to be too good to be true, for about a year and a half I was clean, enjoying my life, until 6 months ago when I began to develop acne again around my cheeks, jawline and back of my neck.

It was not unusual to see me constantly wiping the excess oil from my face and sporting a huge zit or two. As a young adult, I've tried a ton of those over-the-counter products like Noxema, Clearasil, Proactiv, Neutrogena, etc. But I found that as I got older my acne just got worse. So, I began seeing a dermatologist and we tried several things: doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline, epiduo, differin, tretinoin, clindamycin and birth control pills (for the benefit of clearer skin). And I must admit that some of these regimen helped but the minute the doctor felt that it cleared up enough and stopped the medication, my skin would worsen. So, with my oily skin and now experiencing breakouts more frequently and especially around my mouth and jaw area, I had had enough and decided to try Accutane. 
Medication: I was prescribed MYORISAN 40mg for 6 months.
Experience: In the first month, the breakout could be described as the worse I have ever had. I had developed larger, more painful and a lot more acne than at any time that I could remember. I was so discouraged but had to keep believing in my dermatologist's promise of clear skin. After the first month, the breakout lessened and my skin began to dry out. Now I was required to moisturize my skin which was something that I would have not have dared to do prior to treatment. My lips began to chap and crack but that was easily remedied with chapstick or any other type of lip gloss. My skin was a lot more sensitive than before. I used to be able to wash my face with warm water and a wash cloth, but now the skin was so thin/dry that it would actually damage the skin and develop a scab the next day. I had to wear sunblock and a hat when I exercised in the park. If I didn't wear enough, I would suffer a mild sun burn. I didn't suffer any nose bleeds or depression. As the months went on I became acne free. And I was even told by someone that I had beautiful skin. Can you imagine my surprise?! I was in heaven.
My dermatologist recommended that I apply Epiduo and tretinoin to my skin every two days after I took my last Accutane pill. This surprised me because I thought my days of acne medication were over. After I took my last pill, my skin remained clear and dry of excessive oil for a couple of months but gradually I began to develop a few small zits and my skin was becoming oily again. This was not the promise that my dermatologist gave me. He said I'd be acne free and at the very most I would be a small bump around the time of my menstruation. I can without a doubt tell you that is not my reality. 
It has now been almost 6 months since I completed my Accutane treatment and I am once again carrying around napkins to wipe the excessive oil from my face throughout the day. And there are days when I have several zits on my face at any given time. I don't dare moisturize my already oily skin. But honestly speaking, my breakouts are not to the degree of what they used to be prior to Accutane because the pimples are smaller. But I'm unsure that if it's too early to tell and that maybe with more time it may all go back to how it was originally. I guess time will tell.”",isotretinoin,Acne,19,82,0,oral

I had to come on here and write a glowing review for everyone who was in the position I was before starting. My flare up began the summer of my senior year of high school and got so terrible when I moved away for college. It was so bad and I was so embarrassed that I moved back home. Huge hard cyst type zits all over my face with redness. No amount of makeup could hide it. I finally made the choice to just do this treatment. It's the best choice I have ever made. I have actually been off of it for almost two years now and still don't get much... a few every now and then but small and hardly ever. The side effects- NOT THAT BAD. Yes I had very dry eyes... but nothing some good drops couldn't fix. I also had a dry nose but nothing some good spray couldn't fix. Towards the end of my treatment I even started my outdoor college soccer practices. I was in the sun, I was running and out of breath, but everything was just fine! The worst part about this drug for me was taking the pills. I have a fear of swallowing pills but I did it with some yogurt and it's no big deal. Here's the thing... FOLLOW THE RULES. My sister took this before me. She ruined it for herself. She decided smoking while taking it is no big deal... wrong. It ruined her breathing to a point where she had to stop the drug... and her skin was much worse than mine. 5 years later she is on it again and doing great. So don't listen to all the scary reviews.

I'm your typical 18 year old lad and have never written on a forum before but I want to write something for the people that are worried about taking this (in my opinion) miracle drug. I am coming to the end of my 6 month course and I can honestly say it's been life changing. 

Before I started Roaccutane, I was fairly depressed and seriously lacking confidence due to my appearance. But after months of failed treatments on various antibiotics, I was referred to a dermatologist who instantly said there's only one way to fix my acne problem, Roaccutane. At first I thought this is the worst case scenario and I'm going to be even more depressed as a result of the possible mental health side affects. Depression has run in my family so I was very worried. However, living like with acne wasn't something I was prepared to do, so I started the course on 40mg a day.

The first week I had a headache daily, but thankfully these die off after a week and paracetamol and ibuprofen will take all the pain away. Almost immediately, my lips were cracking and from then on in, I never went anywhere without some Carmex lip balm in my pocket.

As the first 3 months went by, I was still breaking out and was starting to think it isn't going to work. However, I'm so glad I stuck with it because now I haven't got a single spot of my face and the scars have faded to the point where you can barely see them! After the third month, my derm upped my dose and I started to take 60mg a day. 

Luckily for me I hadn't had any serious side affects. Just your occasional nose bleed and dry skin, and sometimes my eyes were a bit blurry but it's not much of an issue.

Anyway, I just want anyone reading this that is worried about starting this medication, that not everyone has a horror story about Roaccutane and I couldn't be happier at how it's made me feel!!

I had tried almost everything from prescription creams neostrata proactive to minocycline amd doxycycline but none of it did anything and I had terrible reaction to alot of the creams and pills
I had been prescribed accutane years ago and read all the side effecst and threw it in the garbage but after talking to a couple doctors and trying almost everything I could think of I decided I would give it a shot. I had tried everything else and the reviews were pretty promising. 
The first 10 days I had the chapped lips that never stopped and my skin was inflamed to the point it looked like I had a sunburn. The fact that I work in a potash plant didn't help matters. Was like have salt thrown on your wounds and having to wear a respirator was unbearable. Fortunately I had holidays for the next 10 days and being away from work made it easier. My job is very physical so already I wasn't sure this would work. I noticed I started to get a bit depressed which I knew was a side effect but grew increasingly more concerned when  I read it can potentially be a permanent side effect even after discontinued use. 3 weeks in I started to get chest pain and it was bad it would come and go and that bothered the hell out of me the first time I didn't worry about it but then it happened again and much worse. I became very concerned for my heart and stopped taking the pills all together. At that point I was only 3 weeks in and was just hoping I would be ok. After stopping I still had chest pain a few days off and on. Then the other pains started with my back and my feet. At this point I was at work and it was killing me. Especially my feet. They hurt so bad I wouldn't leave the couch when I got home after work and I would just hurt to the point of tears. Painkillers did nothing for me which was highly unusual. I started to do some research about the foot pain and some of the reviews I came across scared the hell out of me. People that had taken accutane only a short few weeks like myself and been in pain constantly ever since. Others who had taken it and could no longer work or do anything. This became terrifying for me as I had not considered that 3 weeks of accutane  could possibly cause me horrid pain the rest of my life. With all the pain and fear I also became increasingly depressed. I spent a lot of time hating on myself and the reviews I read on they were equally terrifying. 
I was so scared that this was the worst thing I had ever done to myself.
Did I mention you absolutely should never drink on accutane. I was on holidays and had one drink and instantly regretted it. Was in bed the rest of the night
After a month of all this since I had stopped the pills the pain finally went away and I have never been so grateful. I hoped everyday that the constant pain would not be a permanent thing and fortunately I got very likely.
Also would like to add that none of my acne cleared up not that I was surprised. But I now no longer care. That was the stupidity thing I ever did in thinking that I would not be affected by the horrible side effects of accutane. No one thinks it will happen to them but obviously it happens to some people or they wouldn't be listed as side effects and these bad reviews wouldn't exist. 
To those of you still suffering I hope that your pains go away. I got Lucky and for that I am thankful

Im a 24 year old white female, I've had acne on my face/shoulders ever since I can remember. A typical breakout for me would consist of about 10-15 pimples and blackheads on my nose and chin area. I've tried everything from antibiotics to creams/face washes. Nothing has ever helped me. When I turned 18 I decided I had enough with the acne game and decided to see a dermatologist. I was put me on spironolactone 100mg once a day. I took spironolactone for a few years and yes, it did help a lot. My face was finally clearing up and I was happy with the results. Fast forward 6 years and my acne slowly started coming back. I was getting breakouts on my cheeks/forehead and my blackheads were still present (mind you they never cleared up on spironolactone). 
A friend of mine started Accutane and saw amazing results pretty quick. I never thought I could get on Accutane because they say  ""Accutane is used to treat severe nodular acne"". And while I had what I considered severe acne...I never thought it was ""that bad"". But I decided to go back to my dermatologist and ask about it. My Dr. was extremely supportive and agreed that I was a good fit for Accutane since prior remedies were proven no longer affective. 
I've now been on the drug three months and I just can't express how happy I am with it! Within a month my blackheads were gone!! That right there was amazing to me. My face is no longer oily and my ""breakouts"" are down to about 3 pimples (which will eventually become zero!). I haven't experienced any weird side effects. I started using moisturizer on my face DAY ONE. I think that was very important because I've never had any bad dry patches on my face. 

My daily facial routine consists of:

CeraVe Renewing SA Lotion: applied to my face as soon as I get out of the shower in the morning (face still wet) or after washing my face at night. Works very well under my make up. 

I wash my face with Dove bar soap morning and night. 

For my lips I use Lanolin cream. WORKS WONDERS. Can be purchased at Target, grocery stores, Walgreens...

How bad do you want it gone?
These are just a couple of questions that you need to answer before taking this drug. If your acne is bearable and you feel you can control it with over the counter medicines than do so. I had moderate acne since I was in 8th grade and I had tried everything out there. Accutane worked miracles. I have confidence... you just start waking up without breakouts. The side effects are bad (severe chapped lips, chapped face, I was tired all the time, acne got worse). I would do it again if I could. 6 months of hell for a lifetime of great skin.

After trying everything under the sun I gave in and went back to my Dr who recommended I try the new, stronger version EpiDuo Forte. It takes time but this stuff always works. It was probably about three months until my skin cleared and I was only left with scarring. With patience, and consistency (probably the other most important thing) and a simple skincare routine that compliments EpiDuo Forte it works best.

However, it’s been a while since I’ve started using it and I still can’t tolerate using this twice daily because it’s just so harsh on my skin. When I use it once a day for 2-3 consecutive days, the pimples are usually gone by then and my skin would stay clear for up to a week.

The pimples were angry and painful. I tried over the counter creams with no relief and they continued to get worse and worse. 
I went back to the dermatologist who said I couldn’t go back on roacutane and prescribed me epiduo cream and doxycycline for flare ups. 
It took around a month to start seeing results but the pimples became smaller and less angry. 
I’m 8 weeks down the track now and my skin is practically clear with some deep blackheads still making there way to the surface. 
The cream did cause my face to burn and feel really uncomfortable for the first few weeks though it eventually got used to it and the results are worth it! 
I do burn incredibly easily on my face if I go in the sun at the moment and by accident I got it on my neck one night which was agony (avoid the neck lol).

Fewer pimples that didn’t last as long.  
After 1 year on Epiduo Forte my now 18 year old daughter is in her freshman year of college rocking her completely clear skin!!  Not a pimple in months and her hyperpigmentation has faded as well.  I’m so thankful for this product.  I’m convinced her next step would have been accutane and I’m so glad she kept going even when she was completely discouraged in the beginning.

Once the uncomfortable stage was over, I experienced two purging stages along with pimples here and there when I wasn't purging. Even though this was disheartening, I remained patient. My skin, although not perfect, is looking extremely good as of today. I'm thankful for this medication because if this did not work, I would have to resort to Accutane which would suck.

So, overall, really good medication if you can be patient and can endure some pain (mental and physical). The purging can suck mentally and the first few weeks can be super uncomfortable because of the red, irritated, itchy skin. Do give it a try if nothing has worked for you so far!

My face would burn all day and I was feeling horribly all over my face. I couldn’t even apply moisturizer or makeup because it would sting. I guess my face was too sensitive for such a harsh product :/ I have mild hormonal acne, with blackheads and milia in my jaw and cheek region.”",Adapalene / benzoyl peroxide,Acne,1,12,1,topical gel

My skin is extremely sensitive and I have been suffering from hormonal acne for the past 3.5years.

I applied epiduo for the first time and my skin turned red, dry and patchy. I was also breaking out much more on the areas that I applied the cream. Hence, I stopped applying the cream. 
I later heard from my doctor that this was a normal reaction and have to be used for a minimum 4-6 weeks in order to see results. So, I decided to give it a try again a few weeks later after my skin had healed. This time, I broke out even more on my chin and had several cystic acne that has been so painful to deal with. Beyond that, my skin started to burn and even my lips turned so dry.

Now, I'm dealing with the newly formed cystic acne and dry skin. I do not recommend epiduo for sensitive skin.”",Adapalene / benzoyl peroxide,Acne,1,12,1,topical gel

Week 2:
Skin still dry and flaky, but not as bad as week 1. Again, less new pimples popping up and old pimples starting to reduce in size.

Week 3:
The purge! Suddenly (overnight), a lot of pimples came out of nowhere, which I was expecting, but was still a bit alarming. One thing I noticed was that although there were a lot of new pimples, they were healing very quickly. 

Week 4:
Clear skin! For the first time in a long time my skin is 95% clear. I will continue the treatment for a least another two months just to make sure my acne doesn’t come back, then I’ll start to tone down the treatment.

Here's what I do:
-Wash my face with a gentle cleanser (I use Aveeno Positively Radiant)
-Put on some cerave moisturizer
-Wait 20 minutes
-Put on the epiduo forte

I only do this at night, once every 2-3 days. If I feel my skin getting irritated, I'll stop using the epiduo till it gets back to normal. Don't muck around with your skin!

First, Retin A will make the skin soft and susceptible to damage so do not pick skin as it can rip off layers causing scars. I use a sensitive skin soap such as Cetaphil sensitive skin soap. DO NOT scrub your face which stimulates sebum production. Use your finger tips and be as gentle as possible washing face AM/PM daily.
When starting retinoids/ Epiduo, apply at night after washing and let face dry 20min. Apply 50/50 with Cetaphil eczema sensitive skin moisturizer. If you skin is red skip a night but I found that this moisturizer will eliminate the redness.

The best way to do this is to buy a gentle cleanser and moisturiser (Cetaphil and Eucerin are fantastic as they're formulated for skin undergoing acne treatment). Cleanse and moisturise morning and evening, and follow with a very thin layer of Epiduo every evening. The dryness and flaking disappears after 10-14 days, so be patient.

Also if your skin is really sensitive use all your moisturizers and creams first and wait ten minutes then apply epiduo last. It won't be as effective but also won't be as harsh. I like to use face masks for moisturizing so I use epiduo in the morning with a moisturizer and sunscreen. At night I use a sheet mask for moisture. It's a good balance for me.

Regarding the side effects, I didn't experience severe burning and chapping but I think it's because I had been on Clindoxyl and my skin had toughened up to the medicines.

The first thing my doctor told me was, EASE into it! use a VERY light layer and ONLY at night - not in the morning as well. A pea sized amount is enough. Put it on your finger and dot it around your face and then massage them out. He also told me that if it starts to burn/hurt, STOP using it for a few days.

You should NEVER EVER keep using it when your face is in pain, obviously. 

Plus you need a very good, heavy moisturiser.

My first thought was I will not use this no more. I stopped for two days and just moisturized to heal my skin. I started back up again and told myself pain is just a physical feeling that the mind can overcome. I'm pulling through it and guess what?

I'm using it until today and am so happy with the results. Everyone noticed how the acne disappeared. I just get one or two pimple when I'm having my period.
You guys should use it if you're having the same problem. I wish I can post a picture of before and after so you can see the difference. It's really good, I don't want to stop using it.”",Adapalene / benzoyl peroxide,Acne,1,12,1,topical gel

You have to wait for your face to completely dry between layers. Wait at least 10 minutes. So once that's dry, apply the Epiduo in a thin layer all over your face. Let dry for 15 min.

*If you have gone thru a course of antibiotics you should consume probiotics regularly to balance your gut flora which will affect acne in a positive way* 

Natural ways to try 

- Increase your fibre intake

- regularly consume probiotics 
- pass bowel movements regularly 
- drink a minimum of 2 litres of water daily 
- test for food sensitivities 
- check hormone levels through blood work

If it does happen, invest in a skin regenerating night cream to bring back your natural oils) I also used alpha arbutin serum to fade scars and SPF30 in my moisturiser which helped a lot!

Weirdly I’d been on it before however I didn’t find it as effective - possibly as I’d been using another benzoyl peroxide product prior to it - Duac. Duac cured my mild cystic acne and kept my face crystal clear for 2 years but then suddenly I started to get bumps that never came to a head. I’m convinced it’s because I started using a Clarisonic and not cleansing with acne preventative ingredients. Anyway, excited to see what the next couple of weeks are like!

Skin still dry and flaky, but not as bad as week 1. Again, less new pimples popping up and old pimples starting to reduce in size.

The purge! Suddenly (overnight), a lot of pimples came out of nowhere, which I was expecting, but was still a bit alarming. One thing I noticed was that although there were a lot of new pimples, they were healing very quickly.

Clear skin! For the first time in a long time my skin is 95% clear. I will continue the treatment for a least another two months just to make sure my acne doesn’t come back, then I’ll start to tone down the treatment.

My skin is still red and I still have issues with occasional tiny whiteheads on my inner cheeks, smile lines, and the sides of my nose, but the texture of my skin couldn't be softer or smoother everywhere else. My forehead, chin, jaw, and outer cheeks are perfect. I've managed to cut back on makeup, and have hope that in another 6 months my skin will be 100%.

The two things with this cream is time and persistence. At first it will seem everything is worse, dry/burning/peeling skin which is red raw. Only apply minimally at first (1 small blob) and allow your skin to get used to the cream otherwise your skin will burn. After time you can start to apply more.

First, Retin A will make the skin soft and susceptible to damage so do not pick skin as it can rip off layers causing scars. I use a sensitive skin soap such as Cetaphil sensitive skin soap. DO NOT scrub your face which stimulates sebum production. Use your finger tips and be as gentle as possible washing face AM/PM daily.
When starting retinoids/ Epiduo, apply at night after washing and let face dry 20min. Apply 50/50 with Cetaphil eczema sensitive skin moisturizer. If you skin is red skip a night but I found that this moisturizer will eliminate the redness. 
Apply moisturizer in the AM after washing/softly drying your face. Use sunscreen”",Epiduo,Acne,1,12,1,topical gel

I never use it anywhere near my eyes but around my jawline two days in a row and any breakouts have gone.

When enough was enough, I went to my doc and he prescribed me this. If I could marry this product, I would (lol!). It worked instantaneously on my skin. I barely had a ""purge"".

Although it did take a lot longer than many people have said it took them, it is so worth it. I also think my problem was that during the school year I would take a shower then put epiduo on before I went to bed, while my hair was still wet, so when I feel asleep it may have washed some of the epiduo off.

I finally broke down and went to my GP who prescribed me doxycycline, clindamycin gel, and epiduo. I only very recently started this regimen, but I am seeing results. The epiduo does burn and dry out my skin, which is why I SPOT apply it every other day. It sounds like some people apply it to their entire face, which I do not recommend unless absolutely necessary.

When I first started using it, I had at least 5 spots a day and my skin also had lots of small bumps underneath it which you couldn't really see in certain lights, but none the less, it didn't give my skin a great look. 

So during the first few weeks of Epiduo, you will most probably break out, a lot. I did, and yes it is disheartening but the results are so worth it. My skin is now near perfect and although I sometime do get the odd spot, I am no longer self conscious about my skin, which I definitely was before!

My horrible cystic acne that covered my entire face (forehead, cheeks, chin, jawline) is about 85-90% better and I actually feel like I have skin again.

There are some side effects at the beginning but honestly just be patient. I got SUPER dry red skin around my mouth and chin for 2 weeks, and the acne didn't go for a month. Its a bit of a tough time as you're sore from spots as well as dryness but just trust the process! I switched my moisturizer to bio oil gel, which is ok to use on the face, and it helps to reduce spot scars and discoloration. It is a  heavy duty moisturizer but you need it especially to begin with. Everyone in my life keeps commenting how fresh my skin looks. Only regret is I didn't use it sooner.

I did suffer from the side effects fairly badly, I had a rash/burn on my cheeks and chin, had dry skin all over and also got a rash on my neck despite not applying duac to it. My advice with duac is to slowly incorporate it into your skin care routine to allow your skin to adapt to it. Also, use a very hydrating moisturiser (even if you have oily skin) twice a day.

It was weekend, so couldn't go to see my GP straight away. Had to call my friend doctor who said that the redness is caused by allergic reaction. Apparently it took time before Duac got absorbed into my skin and reached blood capillary. That's why it took a while before allergy appeared.

I had no red dry skin, the spots looked smaller...this made me think that maybe mine was out of date or hadn't been kept in the fridge before use like it says to do. Maybe I just have really resilient skin (as I have had acid peels). So for me, this was good.

Without birth control I have periods that last 12 days, 5 of them with a heavy flow and very painful menstrual cramps. I also have a lot of acne (not cystic) if I don't take Yaz. All of these are symptoms of having too much testosterone/having a higher affinity for testosterone. Yaz is anti androgenic, which means that it reduces the male hormones in your body/blocks their effect. I believe that Yaz won't help you if your acne is not caused by too much testosterone. 

It took 7 months for me to see any effect on my acne, and it stayed the same until it went away. The only side effect I had was sore boobs for about one month, but I've never had any problems with hormones affecting my mood, so you might want to bear that in mind.

The side effects that I noticed in the beginning - breakthrough bleeding, increased hair shedding, went away after the first few months. I feel that I stopped some of the side effects with vitamins and supplements. It is so important you supplement with certain vitamins as the pill depletes these - zinc, B vitamins, iron, vitamin E, D3, etc. I also take MSM (sulfur) which stopped my hair shedding and regrew my hair thicker.

I still have pimples but they are really small and go away in a day and it could also be because I'm eating really bad at the moment.

But anyway,  I suggest you to try it if you don't want babies and acne, just be patient, I know it can be tough the first months but it's worth it  !

Menstruation is lighter however, have some light spotting mid cycle, and suspect my body is still adjusting to medication after only 2 months. 
Mood generally more even and cool, fewer extreme lows.
Side effects! I work 12h days and also run long distance and I’ve noticed a drop in my stamina. A couple of days where I’ve felt overwhelming fatigue. Suspect it is due to the way drug counters natural testosterone.”",Drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol,Acne,53,377,42,oral

However I have gained no weight and do not have that bloated ring around the belly or waist. I also no longer have sleepless nights before my period. This has solved skin issues and sleeping issues for me without bad side effects. My breast did increase in size but for me that is not a negative side effect.

Started my first pack on my period, resulted in a month-long period. Then skipped my period to see if that would end it, but it resulted in another month of having my period.

I was hesitant to try Yaz because it poses a high risk for blood clots.  If you’re thinking of trying Yaz or Yasmin, definitely get blood tests to see if you’re at risk for blood clots.

My only complaint and reason for considering switching is that after taking this long term, I recently developed spider veins on my thighs. I have NEVER had such a thing so it was very concerning as I am only 25 and in very good health, and as I know there are increased risks for DVT while taking this drug. Recently the areas on my thigh where the spider veins developed have become somewhat painful at work (as I stand all day). I attribute the development of the spider veins directly to Loryna as this is only medication I have taken the past couple years. It is such a shame because I absolutely love what it has done for my skin (flawless even during the time around my period), but the veins cause a large concern for me so I am heavily considering switching.

I thought it was just hormonal changes. I couldn't take it anymore, it wasn't going away no matter what I did. I went to the doctor & he put me on Minocin twice a day & within a week my face is 98% clear. I can hold my head up again with confidence.”",Minocycline,Acne,15,146,26,oral

Starting off with the pill, I had about 8 painful zits on my chin. I noticed it beginning to clear after the second week. By the time I hit the sugar pills I began breaking out again on my chin and oddly in between my brows. I continued on to the second month, always breaking out during period week. By the third month though, my chin has been clear. I did get 1-2 tiny pimples during the week of my period, but they weren’t painful like how they used to be. I’ve never seen my chin clear in almost 8 years. No weight gain, but I was a bit moody the first month.

I would have mental breakdowns about stupid stuff and I’m not necessarily an overdramatic or super emotional person at all. Overall, I’ve heard that the first few months of any birth control is not necessarily the best, because you have to get through the side effects before your hormones regulate and your body gets used to it.

Summary of review: DON'T GIVE UP even though the purge sucks!!

The Differin purge lasted for about 16 to 18 weeks for me, but keep in mind that everyone's skin is different. It was horrible. My skin was dry, and waves and waves of nodules and cystic acne would spring up overnight. But all of those side effects started to disappear around week ten . Pimples would still appear, but they would come and go, and barely leave a mark since the PIH scars faded so quickly. I still have some discoloration from the purge, but overall my texture has evened out, I haven't had a single pimple since and my skin has become less oily than when I started. So don't be discouraged! The results at the end will be so much better than dropping out midway during the purge finding new products.

1. Wash you face once at night with a mild, non-acne treatment wash. I use Glossier Milk Jelly.
2. Dry your face with a paper towel. If you research how much bacteria lives in your towel, this will make sense..
3. Put Differin on your face (don't over do it.. Use a small pea-size amount for the whole surface). Let it sit on your face without moisturizer for a few mins.
4. YOU MUST USE A STRONG MOISTURIZER, right after you use Differin and the morning after as well. This made all the difference. I wasn't doing this at first and it changed everything and allowed my skin to heal. I used Weleda Skin Food.

If you are over 30, I suggest not to use this, as it will dry out aging skin, even with moisturizer.

I seemed to be able to combat inflammation by using a benzoyl peroxide face wash and aloe vera gel as part of my routine. For me personally, dryness and skin flaking was far worse than the purge. It took about 7 weeks for my skin to adjust to adapalene, and even with two moisturizers layered on, I had the worst dryness and slight irritation. That said, once I hit 8 weeks, noticeable improvements started happening. About half of my comedones are gone, dryness is now manageable, and hyperpigmentation scars are starting to fade a little bit. I expect all of these areas to keep improving now that I'm getting closer to the 12 week mark. This was a process that had growing pains, but I am so glad to have stuck with it.

I was using tazorac on my skin for years, then my insurance wouldn’t cover it.

I decided to try differing because the tazorac costs around $500 (or more) without insurance when it used to cost around $20, so I figured I’d try something new. 

I started using differin about 4-5 weeks ago. For a couple days, my skin did start to clear up a bit. And then...

I started getting pimples - and I mean large, very noticeable red ones - literally all over my face in random places where I have NEVER gotten pimples before IN MY LIFE.

right now there are 3-4 total at the top of my forehead, 4-5 on each cheek - it’s the worst my skin has ever looked. It’s the large cystic kind that leave scabs, too, and I’ve never ever gotten those. I’ve always just had “one here or there.””",Ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate,Acne,1,10,0,topical gel

1. Always use this at night time just before going to bed and within 5 mins of its application light should be turned off as this medicine makes skin light-sensitive.

My tips are to keep up with using differin, and only use a small amount. Like very small. Too much made my skin so itchy and red, and wasn't effective.

On top of the meds, cold weather and dry heat inside buildings at the time was making my skin burned so badly. Then, I figured out that putting lots of good gentle, plain lotion right after washing my face really helped. Sunscreen was super important. Now I continue to use Differin to help with hyperpigmentation since I couldn't help picking on my face when I wasn't supposed to! No more pimples. My skin keeps getting better day by day.

The first 24 hours: I bought the Differin gel and the soothing rapid hydration moisturizer. Based on other reviews I opted to put a thin layer over my entire face rather than as a spot treatment. A part of me expected to wake up with swollen eyes and a very red face. To my amazement Differin not only reduced my acne by half overnight, it didn't irritate my skin AT ALL!

Tips: Apply once daily ( at night) to clean, dry, moisturized skin. It is very important to apply moisturizer to clean wet skin and massage in. Allow the skin to air dry and after 20-30 minutes, apply the Differin. This cuts down on the drying, flaking, and stinging. Only a pea-sized amount of the Differin is needed for the entire face. Don't use in combination with salicylic acid. It deactivates Differin. It is very important to resist the urge to scrub or pick at the skin.

I've been on it since I first started going to the dermatologist in my early teens, which now is about 4-5 years ago, so I've been using it for 4-5 years. Tretinoin has been my way of keeping my skin at bay while other things in my life may be keeping it from staying acne-free, like if I switch birth control pills or if I forget to wash my face. I use 0.05% and I use it once a day at night accompanied by a moisturizer. It's worked for me.

The best advice I would give is DO NOT LOOK AT YOURSELF TOO MUCH IN THE MIRROR, make it quick! Acne will affect you more emotionally if you keep on looking at it. I would cry and be so depressed for the last 3 months.

I officially started using Retin- A .25 just under 4 months ago today.  My first day was 3 weeks before my birthday.  I remember contacting my Dermo in advance with a million questions and mostly the fear of going through THE PURGE during this busy time filled with celebrations, events, etc.  I thankfully, made the gamble and started!  I decided it was always be... I'll start next week, next month.  Let's be real, when is there ever a good time for acne?!  
I can only describe the last 4 months as a roller coaster.  There will be good days. There will be days you hide inside. At some points I thought I was done purging, then it would come back.  IT TAKES TIME.  Painful cysts too, that do not go away.  I would rather have 20 white head pimples all over than 1 deep painful cyst on my face!  It was the most challenging thing I've gone through. It will test your patience.  To the point of tears, and why me's!  At one point I scheduled an emergency Dermo appt to receive Cortizon injections on 3 cysts that were almost the size of dimes!! I couldn't take it anymore.  This was 2.5 months. He sat me down and said it takes 3-4 months for results to be reached and you will hate your dermo for that time and gave me the push to continue to go forward.
Here's the good news!  I am at my 4 month mark, and I have never been more happy.  I haven't had a break out in 1.5 weeks.  I don't know the last time I've been able to say that. I can take on the CALI summer and not feel like I'm hiding.  My biggest advise is be strong!   Tell yourself everyday, it's only 4 months of the rest of your life.

Some derms may tell you to increase your spironolactone dose quickly or they may tell you to start out on 50mgs twice daily- but trust me this is not a good idea.

I have dryness which is both flaking and also chapped red splotches that I’m sure will go away over time.

One year on my skin is AMAZING.  I don't get cysts and spots any more. I have gained so much confidence and spend so little time thinking about my skin. So if like me you feel you have given up hope, I suggest you give this a go. A note of caution is that in the first 3-4months my skin purged terribly. It was awful and I nearly gave up. Also felt incredibly thirsty and couldn't stop going to the loo (they are a diuretic and make you pee). This has however all settled down. Body seems to have adjusted. No other side effects.

My skin was always inflamed and the healing process was extremely delayed... it was horrible!  I have read many reviews that mentioned an adjustment period (a month or two of worsened acne) prior to any desired effects, but - for me - this was not the case.  This medication proved beneficial within the first week and continued to improve as the dose was adjusted (though I am still only on a very small dose, twice a day).  One added (and unexpected) benefit was that I stopped getting cold sores.  Seriously.  Recurrence  of cold sores was getting entirely out of control (to the point where I was having to take preventative medicine nearly every other day) and - after starting this medicine - the recurrences completely stopped!  Best side effect ever!  Anyhow, my skin is now clear - with exception of the rare tiny pimple - and I am free of cold sores.

Then shortly before I turned 21 I started getting acne on just my chin (combo of closed comedones and hard small cystic acne) and after about a month of dealing with the acne, hoping it would clear, I saw a dermatologist and asked to be put on spiro since I read good reviews. She told me it was for older women and just put me on tazorac .05% and aczone 7.5%. The tazorac completely tore up my face but after a month my skin got used to it and definitely was helping the texture of my chin but just not stopping the acne (plus taz made my skin super sensitive so when I would frown or move my face a lot my face/chin would turn kinda red... definitely unflattering and not a good topical for summer months) and the aczone was helpful but not stopping everything. Fed up with my derm, I saw a second derm who took one look at my face and suggested spironolactone and benzaclin (antiobiotic). I stopped the aczone and started the benzaclin which worked really well for a couple of weeks and then didn't work well so I stopped it entirely. I started on 25 mg spiro once a day for a month last November 2016. I didn't see results so my derm upped it to 50 mg in December. I started to see small results like decreased oil production on my face and hair but nothing truly impacting the acne. In January I went up to 75mg for a few weeks and then 100mg (50 twice a day) and that is where I am right now (March 2017) and my face for the first time summer 2016 is completely clear. I almost feel like I'm jinxing myself for typing that but it's been a full month without any sort of pimple (even during my period). I can also go two days without washing my hair and my hair would usually be oily by the end of the day so that is a HUGE plus... and the oil on my nose decreased by 95% I'd say.  I don't have any side effects, maybe just prone to headaches from dehydration (so definitely drink lots of water) and I have to get my blood tested for high potassium levels since its a diuretic and can make the body retain potassium. I still work out everyday and I don't feel fatigued or anything! I would definitely suggest spiro, it can take 2-3 months to truly get complete clearing but I'm so happy I waited it out.

I've been on Accutane four or five times, and while my skin always did really well for the few months I was on it, sometime afterward I'd begin to get regular breakouts.
