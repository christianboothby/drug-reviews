1,4,"October 12, 2020",, 6,"“Given the 5mg pale peach round tablet to try out for prehypertension 31 days ago. Lisinopril DID help my blood pressure. Pounding headaches, pounding heart at rest stopped.

Downside: I experienced what was most likely intestinal angioedema at the outset. I puffed up though I did not weigh more (3lbs LESS on one occasion). Hard to pass gas or have bowel movements and puffed up and uncomfortable in my lower abdomen most of the time.

Then I woke at 2am when my left eye shot open, turned red and started weeping freely. My lip and cheek on that side became slightly numb and swollen. I knew that I had to take a benadryl right away and stay up to make sure my throat didn't close up. My doc said take another benadryl and go straight to ER if my swelling got worse/went to my throat.

They gave me new hbp medicine and had me destroy my lisinopril.

Chlorthalidone for 5 months and apart from a mild dry cough I was okay but felt some weight gain might be a result despite being diuretic.

I couldn’t figure out what was causing these weird flares but each time I took Benadryl and it would subside in a day or two. I started researching causes of “rapid, itching, burning face and eye swelling” and ACE inhibitors like Linospril were some of the first results that popped up.

Pain went away and lowered heart rate but stopped the lexapro after third night because I felt hot and trouble sleeping but maybe should have stuck with it. Coreg would work somewhat but BP could go up if I felt the slightest bit anxious or angry. Dumped my doctor and switched to a new one.

Sometime over the last few months(?), Lupin Pharmaceutical has changed tablet sizes (I think in all dosages).  My brother is on this medication, has been for 8 years.  He hadn't really noticed the pill size change because he recently changed pharmacies also.  Within the last couple of months, he has had some symptoms that he wasn't sure why he was having.  Primarily, dizziness and lightheadedness, which has also stirred up his anxiety, and fluctuations in BP and heart rate (both going VERY low).  He decreased dose, then stopped taking.  Then BP spiked.  Took lower dose again, and dizziness is back, anxiety is back.  Viscous cycle with little answers at this point.”",Lisinopril,Hypertension,36,296,30,oral

I realize that it takes 2-4 weeks to reach a stabilization point but I had expected the bp to start receding rather than increasing.
 My concerns are: did the change of manufacturer precipitate the increase in bp and also weight gain, lethargy and mild panic attacks?
  I’m going to check with my pharmacy to see if other losartan patients using the Camber brand share the same concerns after the change in manufacturer and also check with my primary doctor to see what alternative meds are available.

Losartan definitely lowers my blood pressure but there is no doubt that it causes anxiety and a feeling of fear.  It seems to amplify an emotional response to any negative thoughts and gets you to fear those questions.

I have found that changing my schedule for taking the medication also changes the schedule of the anxiety.  Ie it follows the taking of the drug by about 3 hours (which is when the drug peaks apparently).
