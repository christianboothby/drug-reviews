When getting off Zyrtec you may experience uncontrollable itching that you didn't have before taking the med, I'll tell you how to get off it without the itch. Start taking 10mg Claritin each night for two nights, then cut Claritin in half to 5mg and take for three more nights then stop taking Claritin, that takes the itch away and Claritin doesn't have the withdrawal itch. Once you stop Claritin and Zyrtec you will quickly lose any weight you gained and mood should improve. Hope that helps.”",Cetirizine,Hayfever,0,239,2,oral

No oral Meds and/or steroidal products rendered relief.  I tried everything from older tried and true decongestant and antihistamine meds to the newer generation antihistamines and steroidal sprays. 

Antigen skin testing from my Allergist -negative.  No itchy eyes or throat. It appeared to be non allergic (vasomotor rhinitis) that is often misdiagnosed by GP’s but common in millions of patients in the U.S.

The result was immediate. 2 sprays in each nostril 2 x daily was like a miracle cure. 

  Educate yourself about this condition that exhibits itself in a similar fashion to allergic rhinitis but is treated completely differently due to a completely different mechanism .  You may want to see an allergist for the antigen skin tests like I did to rule out allergic rhinitis.

Afrin is amazing for IMMEDIATE relief, but the rebound effects after a few days use are just too severe.

My advice is to give it time!  I used both Afrin and Flonase the first few weeks.  I tried to really cut back on the Afrin and only use it if I had to (still led me to using 4xs per day).  
One day I woke up breathing just fine and didn't reach for the Afrin, only used the Flonase.  For the rest of the day,  I didn't use Afrin!

This year I have been miserable, always either sneezing  continually or not able to breathe, or a continuous runny nose, bleeding nose...tired and just not able to function!!  None of this fun or attractive.  I remember my doctor prescribing Nasonex a few years back and I went back and asked for it again. Within 2 days I felt back to my normal self and was able to breathe properly.  No more lethargy and no more nose bleeds.  It truly is a miracle for me with no side effects. ”",Mometasone,Hayfever,0,30,0,nasal spray

Although my symptoms are probably slight compared to most others, this product was easy to use and effective without the harsh chemical feel or taste associated with other nasal medications. Instead of two sprays per nostril, I have elected to use just one spray in each nostril and found my symptoms relieved.

If your opinion of nasal sprays are anything like mine used to be, give Nasonex a try for your seasonal allergies.”",Mometasone,Hayfever,0,30,0,nasal spray

Nasonex has made my quality of life much more comfortable and kept my symptoms more controllable, which in turn keeps other related expenses down.  Because of my financial limitations it is my one necessity, although I wish the cost was lower. Makes my over the counter remedies more effective.  I have experienced no side effects from this drug, only desirable effects.”",Mometasone,Hayfever,0,30,0,nasal spray
