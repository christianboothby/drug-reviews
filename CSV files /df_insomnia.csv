I sleep well when I am alone.  I was prescribed 5mg zolpidem. I only took 4-6 times per month, when sleeping next to my BF and still found that I acquired tolerance and had to move up to 10 mg after a few months. Additionally, if I took the medication AND didn’t sleep well, I would feel extremely depressed the next day. I don’t generally feel depressed so this was very alarming. I would want to cry all day (like sobbing crying) and have some dark thoughts. Be very careful  with this med”",Zolpidem,Insomnia,25,368,3,oral

At first it helped a lot.I thought I would stop using it but when I did my sleeplessness became much worse. I also seemed to need larger amounts to be prescribed to me. I bought things online that I had no memory of ordering. I acted in very hurtful ways toward my loving and devoted  husband.  One night I got out of bed to go to the bathroom. When I thought I was going to sit down on the toilet I was actually sitting down in the middle of the room. My husband caught me and saved me from cracking my head on furniture.  Now I understand that my negative personality changes and hallucinations and ambien-induced amnesia were central to the destruction of my marriage.  This is a terrible drug .

Make sure you don't accidentally exceed your normal dose. I have done that a few times, done things like drive to McDonald's in the middle of the night and grabbed some burgers but had no memory of the events at all.

MAIN TAKEAWAY - take the pill on an empty stomach and don't take it until you're fully in bed and ready to fall asleep. It's a hypnotic so you'll do goofy stuff until you get used it. It's a very hard feeling to describe. If you take it on a full or even mildly full stomach, you can count on it not working at all. That's been my experience for the past 12 years.

I have very severe insomnia. I would rather not have to take any medication but after trying everything, Ambien is the only drug that will burn clean for me. Meaning I don't feel hungover the next day.

Empty stomach, be in bed. I have a fast metabolism, so I do usually burn through it within 4 hours. I just moved to CR 12.5 3 months ago. It's working alright but not a life saver by any means.”",Zolpidem,Insomnia,25,368,3,oral

On day 14 of Ambien CR I developed EXTREME anxiety so I stopped taking it. 9 days later it has almost not improved at all. I'm praying this is just an extreme reaction and will go away over time.

Turns out, Edluar 10mg gets me such great sleep compared to Ambien generic it's like I am taking an entirely different medication. Edluar, 10/10 for decreasing time it took to fall asleep 10/10 for keeping me asleep, and 9/10 for how alert I felt when I woke up in the morning.

Zolpidem only has a  just over 120 min half life. This means that barring a very allergy or genetic disorder,  her condition could not possibly have been zolpidem related. Honestly it sounds like a stroke. I would have her checked ASAP.

To clarify: half is metabolized in 2 hours. That means that by 5 or 6 am at the latest, it would have left her system completely.

This is the main reason this drug is so great for sleep onset and not indicated for sleep maintanance.

Some feel that this could be due to the fact of eating right behind it that since food goes immediately thru the process of breaking down the food and distributing the nutrients of the food thru your system this makes the ambien break down faster and get thru your system quicker. So for those who are having a hard time of meds not working, try it that way. And for the ones that says they woke up after 2 hrs and couldn't go back to sleep, if you find that is you, it is safe to take another one but no more.

If I lose it or my prescription doesn't get renewed before the weekend I could end up being awake for two or three nights. This can ruin a vacation. I've had to go to the ER to get one or two doses because I left my prescription at home. You will not be able to sleep without this drug once you start taking it! I highly suggest trying other over the counter meds first. Also, if you start, stick to the 5mg. That will make it easier to get off before you go to 10mg.”",Zolpidem,Insomnia,25,368,3,oral

Everyone is discussing what else to take in its place, so if you’re going to take something, why not something that works. I have maintained the same dosage for the past 7 years.  I suffer from anxiety and ADHD. It is the only thing that stops the ever racing thoughts when I try to fall asleep. I have also been told by multiple doctors that they do not usually have concerns about its interaction with other medication, when taken in safe doses. Not a lot of other suggested solutions can boost that. There are the occasional nights where just about nothing can stop the racing anxiety brain but, the overall assistance with my sleeping makes my general day to day anxiety significantly better. There is not a lot worse effects on my anxiety than exhaustion. I think the warnings regarding recommended time of taking this should be reconsidered.”",Zolpidem,Insomnia,25,368,3,oral

There's a good reason most doctors are unwilling for it to be given out long term because it is pretty bad to withdraw from and you can start to crave the high that it gives if you stay up, just one night of doing that was enough as I got addicted. I found myself not remembering that I took more than one..... Some nights I took 3 and even 4 one night.

It seems those of us with insomnia find it hard to calm the brain down and repeated sleepless nights makes us more anxious making sleep increasingly hard to come by. Medications like Ambien are effective as they increase GABA in the brain leading to relaxation and then makes it easier to sleep.

The only negative at the time was it was giving me low blood pressure in the mornings but that could of been from other circumstances at the time. My insomnia has come back recently and I was having night terrors every night that left me feeling traumatized and exhausted every morning. It was getting so bad, I was missing work and genuinely miserable. I took trazodone last night and got a full 7 hours, FINALLY A PEACEFUL SLEEP.

It does help with sleeplessness because of its sedating effect. It doesn't guarantee you will fall asleep. There were several nights I can remember when it felt like the trazodone wasn't working and I'd be up all night. The positive was it helped on most nights. But just like other prescription drugs, it is habit forming and does cause dependence even though doctors may say otherwise. I tried quitting cold turkey after a few months and my nights were hellish. Zero sleep, racing thoughts, excess energy in the middle of the night, it was absolutely weird.

My problem was that at some point in the early AM I would awaken (2:30 or 3:00) and feel terrible with anxiety.

It put me gently into a nice sleep, I slept the first time for 7 1/2 hours straight and had only a couple tolerable side effects; my nose gets a little stuffy and a few times I've woken with slight dry cough. I don't know if it's a coincidence, but I've lost 14 lbs since taking it! (2 months) An added bonus is that it helps keep my mind from racing so I CAN fall asleep.

Even though directions says on an empty stomach, I have found with certain people that for some reason ambien works faster when snacking after swallowing med. Some feel that this could be due to the fact of eating right behind it that since food goes immediately thru the process of breaking down the food and distributing the nutrients of the food thru your system this makes the ambien break down faster and get thru your system quicker. So for those who are having a hard time of meds not working, try it that way. And for the ones that says they woke up after 2 hrs and couldn't go back to sleep, if you find that is you, it is safe to take another one but no more.

It seems those of us with insomnia find it hard to calm the brain down and repeated sleepless nights makes us more anxious making sleep increasingly hard to come by. Medications like Ambien are effective as they increase GABA in the brain leading to relaxation and then makes it easier to sleep.

I have cooked scrambled egg/cheese breakfast at 11pm and put it away for breakfast the next day.  Last night, however, was the scariest.  I vaguely remember sweeping up hair, so I looked in the garbage this morning and was relieved to not find any hair. I passed it off as a dream.

DO NOT DRIVE THE NEXT DAY. Even if you feel good! Trust me. 4.) You will get nightmares or sleep paralysis at some point, be prepared. 5.)

It does not put you to sleep like the Z drugs & Benzo's, you must ""wash out"" from these hypnotics for it to work. In other words, your brain must have  titrated off of the other drugs to the point where they have no influence over your sleep.

For me, Belsomra  become my drug for sleep. No Benzo's or Z drug in 36 months & Belsomra helps me every night get 7+hours of sleep.

I must admit the sleep is not deep and I do have vivid dreams every night  but at least I wake up somewhat refreshed. I found adding 25mg of Unisom really helps me fall to sleep and stay asleep. If I do awake, I am able to fall back asleep which I was never able to do with the Z drugs.

You need to wait till a good bedtime for you and take it then. Give it 15 minutes or so then go to sleep without distraction. Don't expect to feel drowsy.

Benzo dependence is a nightmare and causes a lot of the side effects reported here.  You must be gradually withdrawn from benzos, and even then, can still be a nightmare.

To me this is the second best drug I have tried for insomnia.
After many years of struggling including lost work days, Ambien was a miracle to me and since going on it 8 years ago. I only needed about 5mg each night to be out and have 0 side effects from the stuff.  But I want a safer alternative at least for some of the time.  Belsomra seems to be fitting that need.  While it is not even close to being as effective or side effect free as Ambien, it is much better than Sonata or Rozerem.  I do need a higher 20mg dose for the stuff.  It usually kicks in after about 45 minutes and consistently puts me to sleep at that dosage.

Took 2 pills an hour before sleep.  Within 45mins I could tell they were working. I was feeling very sleepy.
I went to bed within an hour after consuming the tablets.
Fell asleep straight away. Sleep was good however I woke up at about 4am needing to go to the bathroom. I tried moving out of bed but was immobilized. This led to a panic attack, as I was unable to get out of bed but I desperately needed to move and to relieve myself. I then fainted. (Due to the panic attack?)

2801,8,"October 12, 2017",, 38,"“First a quick rundown, I'm a 44yr old white male with a whole slew of physical problems. Here's the short list of things hat's been keeping me awake days at a time.  I have CRPS (2012) ,Degenerative Disk Disease C4 -C7 moderate to severe(2001 since 1.5"" shorter). I suffered a T.B.I.( Subdural Laceration .60"") in 2012. Both rotator cuffs that have been torn several times each both of them have SLAP tears and tendonitis ,arthritis in various places. 8 weeks ago I tore my left R.C. for the 3rd or 4th time this time it came with the SLAP tear too. I've had issues with not being able to sleep because of pain for the past 5 years, starting shortly after CRPS reared it's ugly little head. If you aren't familiar with it just imagine all ten of your toes are broken both feet being beat with a hammer repeatedly accompanied by a little fella with a flamethrower that follows you everywhere you go. This is a 24/7-365,  It made me reconsider my position on voodoo dolls because at times I feel as if I'm being stabbed with an ice pick every 10-15 seconds then after 5-20 pokes it moves to a different joint. Imaginary time over now, on the McGill pain scale it's the highest rated pain 48/50 childbirth is a 36,cancer 32 many others listed too. The only difference is those pains go away or have treatment options. Recently the surgeon general changed the approved therapy from opioid pain medications to No  Approved Therapies simply because nothing works for more than a couple of months then your body gets use to the nerve blockers and any and all types and dosages of pain meds. Some choose to have thier feet amputated knowing there may still be phantom pain but that's much lower on the pain scale. Okay now that you know why I'm not sleeping well or at all here is my experience with this RX.  
8 days prior to going to see my Doctor I went to my 1st P.T. session( hurt too much B4 then). During the 2hrs there she pulled and tugged on everything that hurts trying to figure out the range of motion and all that. This was 2 Mondays ago from that day until the following Monday I had slept a total of 9.5 hours going a minimum of 48 hrs between 1.5-2.5 hr naps before the pain would wake me the same as if someone had dumped a bucket of bricks on my head. After a week of this I saw my Dr for my monthly visit and explained everything including how I tried shifting my medications around ,changing the times taken and completely stopping 1 of them for 3 days and another for 2 days with no effect what so ever. He gave me a few choices of medication to try and I choose this one because I've never seen a commercial for it on TV. I refuse to take anything that's advertised on TV. The side effects are usually a more severe of what ever you needed to take it for plus another 20 possible side effects, not 4 me No. I didn't get home until after 1pm so I planned to take it the next time I felt like I was completely drained and might be able to sleep I would take the RX then as it was the best shot for it to work. That ended up being 10am the next morning,Tuesday.  I took 1-25mg pill 15 minutes before I laid down and I don't remember my head hitting the pillow. In the past 15 years that has happened maybe 5-8 times. I woke up twice to use the bathroom and take my other meds for pain, less than 5 minutes after getting up to pee I was asleep again. I woke up 5:30 am Wednesday morning and felt more human than I have in the past 5 years. The pain was tolerable enough that I laid there for a couple of more hours. The best sleep I can remember. Since then my shoulder is feeling a little better so it's not making my normally terrible situation worse and since I've learned to deal with it as best as one can I'm getting back to sleeping 3.5 to 4.5 hours every night. I've only needed to take 1/2 of one since the first.

After 4-5 weeks I had a slight increase in sleeplessness with my phased return into work in play. 

What I liked about this drug was initially it seemed to calm my brain activity down which reduced my anxious thoughts; as time went on though and I started to build up a tolerance, I began experiencing a feeling of arousal/adrenaline in my gut which was too distracting to aid sleep and anxiety for me.

My new psych wants me to try it again.  Since my last post I have had genetic testing that shows I rapidly metabolize mirtazapine.  So my new doctor says I need a much bigger dose to get the same effect others do at lower doses.   Has anyone had this issue?   Has anyone taken it for insomnia at say 30 mgs solely because genetic testing shows they rapidly metabolize it.  I am a little worried about the weight gain but currently I have no appetite at all.  My insomnia is getting better on a short course of Ativan. Slept 7 plus hours last night. But I am  looking for  something I can stay on longer.

-Wake up refreshed, no hangover feeling
-Helped me stay asleep all thru the night
The NEGATIVE were:
-Bad aftertaste, numbness of the tongue, bad breath, metallic taste that lasted 24/7, coated tongue, pain on both sides of the tongue, gums and teeth became very sensitive.

At various times tried melatonin, valerian, diphenhydramine, kava, lorazepam, trazodone, zolpidem, eszopiclone, & CPAP (breathing machine) with mixed results.  Trazodone (25-50 mg) & eszopiclone (3 mg) gave me bad mood disturbances after 2-3 days, done with them.  Melatonin (5 mg) also does this but not as bad.  Lorazepam (0.5 mg) works great but is a benzo so can only use sparingly.

I was prescribed 3mg of Lunesta; for the first night, it worked okay.

I'm 57, healthy fit male. I struggle with insomnia and have since 2010.  It got really bad, wouldn’t sleep consistently for 3-5 days at a time. On the 4th-5th day I’d fall asleep .. sleep for 6-7 hours and then do it all over again.

My doc gave me Amitriptyline, 10 mgs.  I sleep like a baby! And the dreams are incredible. However,  at the 4th day mark I start feeling very achy, a bit depressed, and mentally groggy. I don’t “wake up” mentally until 1-2 pm the following day.  (So, I just use it 2-3x week.)

So, of the prescribed sleep drugs I’ve been given I do like Amitriptyline... it does help me sleep and the dreams are unreal! It’s like I’m in a wild, crazy, adventure movie every night! But, even at a very low dose it causes me to feel a bit depressed, groggy, brain fog, and achy. Oh, almost forgot. It increases my libido a wee bit (hence the wild dreams!) ;-)
