It's the weekend (so no playing) and it's been 2 days since its appearance, and the cold sore is already in the final stages (scabbing and healing) (side note: I have also been taking vitamin D and C because its prime flu season so maybe that is helping, unsure).

Then in 2000, Abreva! Used properly, works like magic elixir. After showering, washing your face, need to re-apply. Being allergic? Can't predict that. Don't use it once you learn that. 
Key: apply upon FIRST notice of tingling. Then, you NEVER GET THE COLD SORE!!! Be sure to apply every few hours, just a little, for a couple days, even a couple applications AFTER tingling stops. You'll end up using about 1/5 of tube; careful with the 1st 'squirts' – it'll come gushing out. Now, generics out there aplenty.

Keeping it down and treated also avoids serious scabbing, cracking, bleeding, which can all add days or weeks in additional healing time.

Abreva is a great topical option to use ALONG with other treatment. There are medications you can use to cut the cold sore short. Do a little research and talk to your doctor to see about getting a script.

Abreva has actually made the sore grow and it blistered up my lip causing it to crack and split down the middle. Ive never had a sore so bad or for more than 7 days. It has been three weeks and it's finally almost completely unnoticeable or gone. I used the CVS brand for a week then began to use Blistex (medicated) which you can buy also at your local pharmacy. I would only recommend using the Blistex chapstick once the sore is scabbed over or almost healed in order to help the healing process and also fasten it.

Examples: DO NOT LICK LIPS, it is such a terrible way to spread to the other parts of your lips and also the inside. I also advise to make sure you put chap-stick to moisten the rest of your lips but not including the infected area because you will spread it. 
Best advise I can give you is apply Abreva as soon as you feel even the slightest bump. It helps it prevent it and quicken the process. Make sure you use a Q-tip because I think the best way to cure a cold sore is being very clean with it and fast to cure.

My ear and the small of my back, right where my jeans hit. Once my ear swelled up so much and my neck too, nothing helped but this cream. It stopped my chin sores (underneath where a second neck would be if I had one) altogether. My back sores happen at severe stress, ugh, abreva doesn't help.

My sore was looking very sinister and just kept growing until I put acyclovir cream on it. It dried up over night and is basically a scab now. It would normally take my sores weeks to go away completely, but from the looks of it now I think this will be gone in a few days. Totally worth the price for me because my work is very much dependant on my face. I was worried I wouldn't be able to work for a few weeks, but looks like I'll be back by Monday.

This medication was amazing- within 24-48 hrs the blisters were crusting over. The swelling and redness was decreasing as well. 
I am on 400 mg 3 x daily for 10 days. I am currently on day 6. 
For the first few days I would feel lightheaded (not dizzy) for a few hours after each dose, but that has gone away now. No nausea when taken with food. I did have a few mild headaches, but that was because I was not drinking enough fluid. As soon as I hydrated, headaches were gone.

Using it in conjunction with Abreva helps promote healing from within the sores; and eliminates the crusty/scabbing that comes with cold sores. Abreva is best used at the first sign of any itching (that familiar feeling of onset) apply as directed on the bottle, and your cold sore will be gone without anyone noticing you even have one.

When I am able to take the medicine as soon as I feel the blister forming, the blister will only last for a day; it will grow and then burst and crust over within twenty four hours, so I've never really had to take the medication for more than 2-3 days.
