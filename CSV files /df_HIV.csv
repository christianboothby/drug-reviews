I spoke to my doctor about some side effect concerns and he told me to give it time.  I’ve been speaking to him for about a year about my fatigue, lack of sleep, weight gain of over 40 pounds, depression, and sometimes numbness in my hands and feet. He says I work too much & it’s all stress related. 
During the quarantine, I stopped taking my meds, ate clean & worked out.  I lost 11 pounds the first month.  I kept the same routine & started taking my meds again.  I’ve gained 2 pounds. This doesn’t add up.
At this point, I don’t know if switching to other meds would be any better.  They all sound like they have similar side effects.”",Genvoya,HIV/AIDS,285,258,18,oral

I’m going back to Tripla and if she doesn’t want to then I’ll take  another leap of faith and get a whole new doctor! I’d rather deal with nightmares and night sweats than stomach problems, muscle cramps, anxiety and depression!

My first days on Genvoya were filled with vomiting ( which is normal after your first doses ). The vomiting went away after a day or so- also due to using ginger to stop the nausea. I also noticed vivid dreams that were not normal to me. Slight weight gain- which was what I wanted. 

I do notice till this day if I go hours without eating my stomach will become upset. Even at night sometimes I have pains that wake me up, but as soon as I eat something, even small it goes away.

I became undetectable after 3 weeks since I started taking this pill. Yesterday I went to doctor and we decided to change my medication because of side effects. I’ve been suffering by diarrhea since I took genvoya. When it was serious I went to toilet even 6~7 times a day. If I ate just a small amount of food or sauce to taste I should go to toilet straight away. The gas irritation was serious, too. Sometimes I had muscle pain. The muscle pain was okay to me. But the diarrhea was really annoying. I have a meal, dinner, a day. I couldn’t understand after toileting in the morning why the diarrhea kept happening even without food. Sometimes I was nervous to go to somewhere if i should drive more than half an hour. Honestly I don’t wanna recommend genvoya if you are thinking about it.

Gastrointestinal - I have either fluffy stools or ones which are too hard to pass, intestinal gas, jabbing pains and generally bloated. Dreams have not subsided. They are still vivid and affect my sleep quality.
The worst is the middle weight gain, all around the belly, same gym regime, same dietary consumption but it's this bloated pillow of fat. NOT recommended!

Back in 2016 I was diagnosed HIV + and for the first year I was dreading sleep, I didn’t want to die in my sleep. I first was on Stribild, and it wasn’t working enough. So then the doctors put me on Genvoya a year later now that Stribild is too expensive for my insurance to cover. Stribild would make me hurt constantly. Now, being on Genvoya I’m healthy though I was having diarrhea most nights. 
So I decided to go another route that is not FDA approved. I have added in  Limu which is a seaweed.. My doctors have now ran tests and since then all my vitals are back to normal, my HIV is undetectable to where they can’t find any trace of my virus and my health is amazing. I’m no longer feeling pain, my headaches are gone. My CD4 count is extremely high. Now they say I may end up living to be a 100. Though I do stay on Genvoya for now.

I will be going in for six month tests within the next few weeks.  I'm a bit worried about cholesterol as while it had been high, I managed to reduce it by a lot prior to taking Genvoya.  In fact, here is a tip.  I lost weight by going on Nutrisystem for 3-4 months (lost almost 30 lbs).  Also, each morning, I mix some greens (spinach, kale mostly) with some fresh or frozen fruit and a scoop of protein powder.

I could feel my nerves going crazy. So I'm going to talk to my doctor and have me switch off to something else even if it's temporary to see if these side effects go away. This has been happening for about 8 months I thought it would go away but it's not.

My doctor did some sort of genes/DNA test to see which drug was compatible for my body. 

Triumeq was the best option suited for me. 
Must admit. At first. It was hard. The first month was as expected. Feeling sick and nausea. Felt like I had to eat when I took my pill. But once into the 2nd month. Things improved. The longer time went on. The less I felt any side affects. 

It took me 4 months to be undetected. 
By this time I felt myself again. 

Now. In 2017. I can take it my meds with or without food. At any time. Sometimes I will take my meds with wine or on a complete empty stomach and feel nothing. I can still take my meds and have no side effect”",Triumeq,HIV/AIDS,64,35,86,oral

Stick to your guns - You know your body better than everyone else!

Less than 2 years ago I was in hospital with a very serious illness which needed to be attended to first before I was able to start Atripla. The period between Christmas & New Year 2012 included a positive result to a HIV test (as a Christmas present) and a CD4 count of 13 as the surprise in the box - Seriously!

It would not be until late March last year when I took my first tablet and have never looked back & currently have a count of 484. I took charge of my body in conjunction with 2 GP's, a specialist and a clinical Psychologist to get me through many hurdles, heartbreaks & trusted friends.
