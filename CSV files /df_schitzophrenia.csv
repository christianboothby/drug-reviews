0,7,"October 23, 2020",Taken for 1 to 2 years, 1,"Invega (paliperidone):			“This drug did completely get rid of the voices in my head and the delusions, it also helped with my physical health a little bit. I had a colon problem which led me to smell very bad all the time, but now I smell like a normal human being after the first few months of being on the injection. Also, my sleep is great. I will say that weight gain is to be expected, this drug will give you an uncontrollable appetite and will probably cause you to gain 40-60 lbs within 6 months. I have also experienced trouble with speech and I feel a little less smart in general. This drug has caused me to have akathisia, I simply cannot sit still or stand still. My vision has seemed to be affected as well, when I don't eat for a while, or when I eat too much, or when I exercise I seem to get black shadows in the corners of my eyes or blurred vision. Overall, this drug is beneficial for people with schizophrenia but it will cause weight gain and a few other side effects”",Paliperidone,Schitzophrenia,86,492,3,oral

Does it manage your symptoms of bipolar/schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder? Yes. But myself and I believe many other people get to a point where they want to move on with their life after years of mental clarity. This drug will prevent that and prevent you from living a healthy lifestyle. It's been proven to elevate blood lipids to unhealthy levels and in some cases cause heart dysrythmia. It's a good medication to stabilize patients with the mental illnesses listed above, but I truly believe this medication should not be prescribed long term, especially if the individual prescribed it has managed their symptoms for multiple years.”",Paliperidone,Schitzophrenia,86,492,3,oral

If I don't take Invega (Trinza or Sustenna) I become anxious, depressed, and suicidal, obsessive, and manic during extreme weather (winter/summer) (I feel better during fall/spring).  My original issues are Unspecified Psychosis/Cannabis Induced Psychosis. Taking the injection helps me articulate myself clearer, be more rational, and reduces my stress tremendously. I usually clench my jaws like crazy as a full-time worker and student. But, Invega relaxes my mind and the jaw clenching pretty much stop.

I can’t recall things and my memories have evaporated.  I feel blunted and flat all the time.  I can’t function in a meaningful way, and feel more depressed than I ever have in my life.

I was told to get checked for the possibilty of breast cancer, and was then treated with aripiprazole in combination to lower the hormone. I am now pregnant with my 2nd child.

Always chasing my losses. It has gotten to the point where I started opening credit cards for more and more gambling.

I do have some side effect from the injection, which most notably is the uncontrollable muscle movments, which I am uncertain if this is unreleated to the drug itself or if I have a form of tourette's.

I feel less anxious on the medication, and seemingly more at ease with myself when I take this medication.  It is a hard step to have people telling you that you actually do better on this pill, when half your life ago, you didn't have ""mental illness"", and suddenly you become someone else.   My weight did fluxuate when on this drug.  But I feel it was due to stress factors outside of a regular environment.  I feel if you place yourself in good surroundings and support you do much better at being the person you are here to be.  I am so much happier in life with a routine.  I feel like I only referred to enlongated periods of sleep because of depression, and events surrounding certain time frames hence thoughts, and reactions.
Abilify (aripiprazole) My instant reaction from this drug is concern for my well-being.  I am nervous because I am one of the people taking this drug till the stars fade, every day to my last.  My doctors all seem to say the same thing, and that is, ""This medication is working for you"".  I do blood tests when I go into the Hospital freqently, and they are not finding anything off the charts and everything is always normal with my vitals. 
My thought is, how do they consider this medication works for me?  Because I am not showing side effects?  Because I am accepting?  I feel I have to hold patience, my own value, what I care about around me to help better myself mentally and my virtue.  I feel that I am just not the type of person to curbside answers to things we wonder deeply about, I guess.  
I don't know if there are any people who would agree then that I should ask if there are any women who have taken abilify during a pregnancy?  Just wondering what the reaction is...  Is my question?  I am a 30 year old female diagnosed with Mental Illness starting in 2004.  I started to take Abilify 20 mg. in 2004 to present.

They recently switched me to abilify, and I’ve gotta say, it’s a hundred times better! I’m back to being “up”, I’m interested in things again, in being productive, I can even work.

There’s still a bit of fatigue, but my concerta, prescribed for ADD, nips that in the bud, and besides, even without the c, the fatigue levels are just nowhere near risperidone levels.

Abilify (aripiprazole) My instant reaction from this drug is concern for my well-being.  I am nervous because I am one of the people taking this drug till the stars fade, every day to my last.  My doctors all seem to say the same thing, and that is, ""This medication is working for you"".  I do blood tests when I go into the Hospital freqently, and they are not finding anything off the charts and everything is always normal with my vitals.

I feel I have to hold patience, my own value, what I care about around me to help better myself mentally and my virtue.  I feel that I am just not the type of person to curbside answers to things we wonder deeply about, I guess.

The downside is that you will gain weight. I have lost some of it by reducing calories and taking metformin. Walking seems to help too.
If you do take this one, stay as active as you can to avoid diabetes because as my psychiatrist told me ""It will happen eventually""
Also, I adopted a vegatarian diet to help lower other risks with this one.
The other downside is that it can make you very tired. I take 400mg at night and 75mg in the morning and another 75mg in the afternoon.

I still hear voices and don't want to be around other people but it is much more manageable and I can at least have some kind of life.

To be honest, I probably would have killed myself if it were not for this drug.

I was more social and less socially anxious. Months down the road, I realized I had mania. It started to cause problems with my relationships because I talked TOO much, and became much too task oriented, less sensitive to my family's feelings, and was agitated. Mania makes you feel great, but it really isn't a good thing. AH started presenting again, so I upped my quetiapine to double the dose (under supervision). Now TD seems to presenting significantly.

957,10,"September 14, 2010",, 28,Geodon (ziprasidone):			“Been on this for 9 months now. I take it at 5pm- pick a time and stick with it staying steady with routine helps with the tired feeling. Don't ever miss a dose- I was really sick one night and couldn't keep anything down so I couldn't take it- didn't sleep at all. I was seeing people that wasn't there- and heard voices calling my name all night. At 1 am I had all lights in the house on. I do have muscle twitching but it's tolerable.”,Ziprasidone,Schitzophrenia,244,347,69,oral

959,2,"September 28, 2009",, 35,"Geodon (ziprasidone):			“When I first started taking Geodon, was very very tired all the time and pretty much felt like a zombie. Noticed a rapid increase in appetite and started getting constipated. Within five days, started getting twitches around my mouth and jaw on the seventh day my tongue swollen up, my jaw was locked and had a grape stuck in my mouth (which I was trying to eat). Ended up switching medication. Cant say my experience with it was positive - still have some mouth twitching even now and tightness in the jaw from it. If you start having twitches, tell your doctor IMMEDIATELY! Dont wait, it should be something they (the doctors) warn you about.”",Ziprasidone,Schitzophrenia,244,347,69,oral

As the months go by you will feel less depressed, more positive thinking, feel better about yourself. I found you have to go with the flow of adjustments to let the brain chemistry change. I'm happy my Doctor has found a Medicine that works. My body feels better too.  Medicine takes time.”",Ziprasidone,Schitzophrenia,244,347,69,oral
