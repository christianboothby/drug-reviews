I haven’t been able to find a preventative that works but I respond really well to the triptans. Even if I catch a migraine late, a triptan will still abort it for me. The downside, I get more migraines each month than pills and I get rebounds pretty bad. For the past 10-15 years imitrex (sumatriptan) and relpax (eletriptan) have been my go-to's. I’ve been having some gastritis issues so we decided to try Onzetra instead of oral sumatriptan to bypass my stomach. AWFUL choice. Two doses of Onzetra barely took the edge off the migraine and I’ve been in severe pain ever since, counting the minutes until 24 hours is up and I can take a relpax. I’ll be switching back to my regular sumatriptan pills ASAP.”",Sumatriptan,Migraine,51,19,0,oral

Been having migraines for the past 5 years, at worst once or twice a month. 2 years back I started taking sumatriptan on doctor's advice, and it works magic. Tends to make me drowsy and a bit dizzy/light-headed for 6-8 hours, but the pain and light/sound-sensitivity dissipates within 30min. The only advice I'd give is to NOT take them and go back to sleep, my body enters some form of giga-sleep where it refuses to wake up at anything less than vigorous physical shaking. Might be just me though. Definitely recommend the med otherwise.”",Sumatriptan,Migraine,51,19,0,oral

I don't even take anything else alongside it which I believe you can. I get pain free inside 40 minutes with a little rest, which is amazing when I know how brutal the migraines can be. A small side effect is a tight feeling in the throat area but it's so mild and the feeling only lasts an hour or two. I know sumatriptan is not ideal for everyone, the possible side effects can be off-putting, but as an otherwise fit and healthy lady I recommend it to similar people. I only have 1 or two migraines a month (the second seems to be an ovulation migraine caused by the sudden rise in hormones, again predictable with a regular menstrual cycle). I'm very lucky to only need one or two Sumatran tablets a month, 2 weeks apart.

Mine starts when the barometric pressure raises or lowers with cold fronts, hurricanes any weather condition that changes the barometric pressure. The pain is rough but the confusion and not able to function for sometimes days on end is the worst. Only advice I could give anyone with this drug is if you know your body well enough to know a migraine or cluster headache is starting take it immediately, don't wait! That is the only way it works for me. When it does work it is amazing! A wonderful tool to the Arsenal to fight these crippling headaches.

Sumatriptan does work. The key is to take it as early as possible. Just when you feel the first tingles of pain - take it. Usually in 30-40 minutes I am pain free. It does come with pretty nasty side effects. For me it's extreme weakness, very heavy feeling arms and legs, low blood pressure and general feel of being unwell. So even after taking it, I have to take it easy - just stay comfortable, watch a movie, read a book, and stay in bed. I usually feel so weak, I can barely walk.

I have used sumatriptan since it became available, both in pill form and self-injection. Yesterday I tried the new patch “Zecuity” for the first time (and likely the last). The actual cost per patch is about $300.00. The packaging is ridiculous: a box overnight delivered which was about two feet square with a weight of about 15 pounds. It contained a large, thick styrofoam container, six special, red “PureTemp Bricks”, designed to keep the drug at room temperature (it must be kept between 68 it 77 degrees Fahrenheit–NOT refrigerated), and a box of four patches. The patches themselves contain the medication, but also the “release/delivery” system which includes a computer chip, the red light to indicate activation and completion of medication delivery (four hours–then the light turns off and patch can be removed) and two lithium-manganese dioxide batteries (perchlorate material), which are considered TOXIC WASTE by the federal government and cannot be thrown away in the regular trash. Instructions say to contact your local authorities to inquire how to properly (and legally) dispose of the used patches. The above in and of itself should give most people pause as to whether this is all worth it. But, as anyone who is suffering from a migraine will tell you, the pain and other symptoms are so bad you feel like you’d try practically anything. So, hey, even though this is the same drug, maybe this fancy delivery system is the magic relief we have been searching for. Personally, sumatriptan lessons the duration and severity of my migraines but has never “relieved’ them. It may for some, but not for me. Other than the powerful narcotics I take for other chronic pain, it’s the only other thing that helps at all. Of course, there are strict limits on the number of times it can be used per month for safety reasons, so I can only use it for my worst migraines. The limit on the patches: no more than four per month. So, okay, I decide to give them a try. I followed all of the (somewhat detailed and involved) instructions and “activate it”, apply it, and push the “start” button and the little red light comes on. Within a few minutes, I start to feel a tingling, itchy, burning sensation, though not too bad and certainly not unbearable, or even anything as bad as the pain of the migraine. Within about five minutes, the gel (I assume the medication), starts to ooze out the sides of the patch, making a sticky mess and of course causing the adhesive of the patch to stop working and the thing starts to practically fall off. Okay, the directions say if there are problems with the patch staying in place to use medical tape. So I use medical tape. All around the entire patch I use medical tape. Five minutes later, even the medical tape starts to come loose due to the ozzing gel, so I apply even more tape, a lot of tape. I am also concerned that there is more medicine sticking to the tape than being absorbed into my body. I also only feel, very slightly, any effect of the sumatriptan. I felt a mild burning sensation the entire time the patch was on, as well as red, irritated, itchy, rashy skin upon removal. Oh yeah, and now what the heck do I do with this environmentally hazardous medical waste? Are most users really going to properly dispose of these things? As far a headache relief, obviously intramuscular injection is a quicker way of getting this drug into your body, to provide whatever amount of relief you are going to get from it as quickly as possible. Another consideration: my health insurance required Prior Approval to cover the patches, part of which was a statement from me and my doctor that the other forms of ingestion of sumatriptan (pill, self-injection, intranasal spray) were inadequate and that I required the patches. When I found that out, I refused and told my doctor to do the same. I had little faith that a 4-hour patch of the same drug would work better than a 5 second injection, and I did not want to give up my ability to keep receiving the injections. The drug company provided the one month free trial (four patches), so I agreed to try them. Several years ago, I remember how happy I was when Imetrix finally went generic and I was able to obtain sumatriptan much cheaper. It saved me (and my insurance company) a lot of money. I don’t really want to give that up either. So, I suppose that there are people who may find these patches amazing and effective, especially those who for whatever reason are unable or unwilling to use the self-injections. For me however, considering all of the factors above, I think I’ll stick with the injectable (pun intended), and sometimes the pills, as I don’t like to carry the auto-injections around in my purse (I already have to carry an epipen with me…). I wish the best to other migraine sufferers; perhaps the patches will give them the relief they seek. For me however, they are not the answer.”",Sumatriptan,Migraine,51,19,0,oral

With regard to those complaining that the product was ineffective or gave you bad side effects, PLEASE read the following. Although Excedrin Migraine and Excedrin Extra Strength are the exact same product, it is vitally important to follow the Excedrin Migraine directions if you are taking the pills for a migraine, NOT the directions for Extra Strength Excedrin! Here's why. Many people have incorrectly assumed that because the two products are exactly the same, which they indeed are, that the directions are also the same. THIS IS COMPLETELY FALSE. The reason that there is a separate product solely for migraines, and the FDA approved it solely for migraine use only, is because the amount you take for migraines is completely different than for general pain relief, including ""regular"" headaches. The reason Excedrin Migraine instructs you to take only 2 pills in 24 hours (vs 8 pills in 24 hours for Extra Strength Excedrin) is because taking more than 2 pills in 24 hours (for a migraine) is likely to cause rebound migraines for many people. In other words, taking more pills than the directions tell you to will make your migraine problem worse! You will note on the Excedrin Migraine package that the ONLY use for the product is ""treats migraines."" Think about that! The directions match that one usage and this is the reason the FDA approved the product. So if you have migraines and want to buy Extra Strength Excedrin, instead of Excedrin Migraine, that's totally fine, but be sure to follow the Excedrin Migraine directions! If you're taking the product for migraines and you take more than 2 pills in 24 hours, you can definitely except to experience the bad side effects that many people have talked about on this site! And keep in mind that although you should NEVER take more than 2 pills in 24 hours (if your using it for migraines), that doesn't mean you can't take just 1 pill in 24 hours. For some people, just 1 pill will get rid of your migraine. If 1 pill isn't working for you, then you can always take another one during each 24 hours. So less is fine, but more is a huge mistake. I hope I've made my point. Review sites in general tend to attract people who have bad things to say about a product. People who have a good experience with a product are much less likely to post their comments on a site like this. Why? Because angry people want to vent. This is not to say that some people who complain are insincere or haven't followed the directions of the product. There are always going to be people who a product just doesn't work for. But most people who properly follow the directions will not have bad results. Also, for migraines specifically, finding a product that truly gets rid of them can be very difficult for many people. It's trial and error. If one product doesn't work, you try another until you hopefully find one that does the trick. So a product not getting rid of your migraines is one thing, but having painful or uncomfortable side effects is another. Follow the directions and you most likely will never have the bad side effects. Whether it works to get rid of your migraine is a coin toss, but at least you won't have the bad side effects in most cases. I hope this helped. Good luck to all migraine sufferers. I know how awful they are.”",Acetaminophen/aspirin/caffeine,Migraine,56,294,83,oral

Now I take the entire 5 mg at once with bayer and gatorade once I notice symptoms and it decreases my migraines from 24+ hrs of hell to around 6 tolerable hours.”,Zolmitriptan,Migraine,50,42,22,oral

I told this to my doctor during my last ER visit and he added Ativan to the IV. That solved the problem.  

My advice is to not avoid the medication because of the side effects. Instead,  ask the doctor about options to reduce the anxiety or restlessness.”",Reglan,Migraine,47,259,9,injection

I would think they where using us as lab rats that med has weird side effects I'm still feeling it. I took it on 9/6/2015 and today I feel jittery & can't relax.

I had this once a year or so ago and had a terrible reaction and insisted I didn't want the IV. However I ended up letting them talk me into it and got it. Within 5 minutes of getting the IV, I felt anxious, trapped, paranoid, like I was going to die. I had to page the nurse like 3 times to come take th IV out. I just wanted to go home. I ended up pacing and walking 20 laps around the hospital with a nurse. They ended up talking me into allowing them to give me Ativan and more Benadryl to reverse the Reglan.

combo worked the best for me.  However,  my doctor 
quit using Maxalt.  So, while searching for new meds. my

Guess we are all different. I will say that I got a solid 8 hours of pain relief and finally sleep but now it's back :( We are having lots of winter storms here so maybe something to do with the air pressure or something?

I'm glad to know I'm not alone and that I wasn't imagining these symptoms.  I literally could not lie in the bed - I was pacing around the hospital room,  and actually had to jump up and down because I was so restless. Absolutely awful feeling - I'd almost rather have the migraine (almost, but not quite). They finally had to give me Ativan to help.
