3,3,"August 28, 2020",, 1,"“So I have been on basaglar for 2 months and as far as the effectiveness of the insulin it isn’t the best but it isn’t terrible either. What is the true downfall of basaglar is the injecting mechanism. For example, tresiba has a mechanism that helps push the insulin out of the pen into your body. Basaglar is completely manual and you must push on the pen forcefully to get the dose out. It may not seem like a big deal but if you have been a diabetic for years you’ll realize that you might need extra help from your pen to push that insulin past all the scar tissue. In closing, the main reason I wrote this was because I just did a dose and no less than 1/4 of the dose was wasted because the pen mechanism is an absolute abomination.

My other son had a different experience -- very inconsistent blood sugar levels.  He had both highs and lows while on Basaglar that were unexplained by other things.  He has a CGM too, so it was pretty clear what happened after the switch.

Wait another hour, still haven't ate anything, 10 more points. I have also had my BGL rise while on it. While on Humalog, my BGL drops and regulates within half hour. Admelog will kick in in over 3 hours and give me a very low BGL. This insulin has made me very sick and nauseous!!!

It can burn quite a bit when injected, this is because Lantus is fairly acidic with a pH of around 4. When the low pH hits the higher pH of the body, it forms microscopic crystals that are absorbed slowly. This precipitating action that causes the burn as well as makes Lantus a long-acting insulin. It helps me to inject the 100 units in 2-3 sites so less goes in per site. Also be sure to leave the needle in for 15-30 seconds to avoid leakage.
